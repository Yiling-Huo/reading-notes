## Abstract

Study 1 (chapter 3): production experiment to investigate how the F0 realization of full tones in Standard Mandarin varies in anticipation of different following tones in connected speech. Two main types attested: 3TS and ATC.

Study 2 (chapter 4): eye-tracking to examine whether 3TS and ATC cues in speech signals can facilitate spoken-word recognition. Results show 3TS effect but not ATC. 

Study 3 (chapter 5): ERP experiment to investigate whether phonological form of predictable words can be pre-activated in spoken language processing. Evidence for 3TS but not ATC. 

The lack of ERP effects at pre-target words does not necessarily deny lexical pre-activation, rather, it could indicate that the cues presented in the pre-target words are not a reliable indicator of the phonological form of the target words.
