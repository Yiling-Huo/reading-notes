title: 'Chapter 5 Study 3: Phonological Form Pre-activation in Predictive Language Processing'
---

This study evaluate whether phonological form of predictable words can be pre-activated in language processing. Testing whether (1) ERP evidence for phonological form pre-activation could be obtained only when listeners could use the acoustic cues in the pre-target word to reliably predict the phonological form of the following target; (2) ERP modulations at target words can index lexical pre-activation. 

## Methods

### Participants

62 native speakers of Mandarin. 8 people excluded from analyses due to artifacts. 

### Experimental design

- To determine whether listeners can pre-activate the phonological form of an upcoming predictable word as a sentence is unfolding. 
- exploiting two types of anticipatory tonal variation cues in MC
- including a condition in which unexpected target words were preceded by prediction-consistent pre-target words
- only using extremely constraining context involving arithmetic calculations. 

### Materials

- 240 two-sentence mini-discourse, a context sentence followed by a critical target sentence.
- 120 involving addition and 120 subtraction of two numbers, which led to the expectation of a specific number in the target sentence.
- in the Correct condition, the critical number in the target sentence was the expected number. 
- in the Incorrect Same Tone condition, the critical number in the target was not the expected number, but it shares the tone with the expected number.
- in the Incorrect Different Tone condition, the critical number in the target was not the expected number, and doesn't share the same tone. 
- target number was either T3 or T4.
- preceding verb was either T3 (*you3*) or T4 (*zuo4*). 
- thus 120 sentences contained 3TS, 120 ATC (T4-T4). 
- 160 fillers, correct 120, incorrect 40.
- 3 lists, each 240 exp trials + 160 fillers. 200 correct trials and 200 incorrect trials.

### Procedure

- listened to stimuli over headphones.
- task was to decide whether the involved arithmetic calculation was correct. 
- button press start - 200ms silence - sentence 1 - 500ms silence - 300ms warning tone - 500ms silence - target sentence - correct/incorrect prompt - button press response - feedback of accuracy 500ms

### EEG recording and data processing

- 28 electrodes, 10-20 system.
- scalp referenced online to left mastoids and re-referenced offline to algebraic mean over left and right mastoids.
- blinks monitored below left eye and outer canthus of each eye

- EEGLAB. 
- epoch extracted from continuous EEG from 200ms before acoustic onset of critical verb through 3200ms later. 200ms prestimulus baseline
- epochs time-locked to the acoustic onset of critical verb and critical number were extracted separetely from the epoched EEG from 200ms pre- to 1000ms post-stimulus onset, with no additional baseline correction. 
- thus all epochs were corrected using -200 to 0ms pre verb. 
- excluded blinks, eye movement, muscle activity, and large drift trials. 
- ERPs for critical verb and critical number were then computed by averaging the artifact-free trials for each subject and condition. 

### Statictical analysis

Mass Univariate ERP Toolbox in Matlab. Mass univariate analysis: better spatial and temporal resolution than ANOVA while maintaining desired family-wise alpha level. 

## Results

### ATC trials

#### ERPs at the critical verbs

No significant difference across the three conditions between 0 and 285ms (the mean duration of critical verbs) at all 28 electrodes.

#### ERPs at critical numbers

Negative effect (incorrect more negative than correct) between 150-300ms, centro-patrietal electroded. Positive effect of incorrect - correct between 500-600ms centro-posterior. 

No difference between incorrect same tone and incorrect different tone.

### 3TS trials

#### ERPs at critical verbs

No significant differences for any conditional comparisons 0-360ms. 

![erp-3ts-verb](/reading-notes/img/sun-yan-thesis/erp-3ts-verb.png)

#### ERPs at the critical numbers

Incorrect same tone - correct: Negative effect between 80-250ms widespread; positive effect between 430-600ms centro-posterior. 

Incorrect different tone - correct: increased negativity to IDT relative to correct 150-230ms, limited to medial and right lateral centro-posterior; positive effect 430-500ms at osterior sites. Effects are similar to IST-correct but shorter induration and more focal in region. An additional negative effect 700ms onward at fronto-central electrodes. 

Incorrect different - Incorrect same: positive effect of different - same from 100-220ms left; short negative effect 530-550ms at Cz and CP2.

### ATC trials vs. 3TS trials

#### ERPs at correct numbers

ERPs were less negative in the 3TS trials relative to the ATC trials from 100-300ms and after 600ms most electrodes. 

![erp-correct](/reading-notes/img/sun-yan-thesis/erp-correct.png)

#### IST minus correct difference

IST minus correct difference were more negative in 3TS than in ATC between 110-150ms centro-posterior.

#### IDT minus correct difference

No significant difference between 3TC and ATC trials. 

## Discussion

- For ATC trials, incorrect numbers elicited an early negativity (150-320ms) and a late positivity (450-650ms) relative to correct numbers. 
- The early negativity resembles the classic N400 effect in topographic distribution but occurred about 150ms earlier in time. 
- Studies show that arithmetic N400 usually occurs about 100ms earlier than typical semantic N400. 
- Spoken N400 is usually earlier than written N400. 

- For 3TS trials, incorrect numbers also elicited an early N400-like effect (80-250ms) and an LPC (430-550ms) relative to correct. 
- Both early N400 and LPC were larger in IST than IDT, suggests that listeners expect the correct number after hearing compatible verb (in the IST trials). 

- Early N400 was reduced in 3TS than ATC trials for correct numbers. Indicates that 3TS enhanced expectation of correct number. 

- Results support two hypothesis: 
    - ERP evidence for phonological form pre-activation could be obtained only when the cues in pre-target words allow reliable phonological prediction of the target word (difference between ATC and 3TS??)
    - ERP modulations at target words can index lexical pre-activation. 

### Lack of pre-nominal ERP effect does not necessarily deny lexical pre-activation

Enhanced N400-like effect to incorrect numbers following prediction-consistent verbs (i.e., the IST condition) in 3TS trials could be viewed as evidence for phonological form pre-activation of the correct numbers. 

Modulation of the N400-like effect was only detected in the 3TS trials but not in the ATC trials. In the latter case, the amplitude of the N400-like effect was comparable between the two types of incorrect numbers. In 3TS trials, the critical verbs contained 3TS cues, which, as found in Study 2 of this dissertation, could help listeners make tonal predictions of the following words. By contrast, the ATC cues in critical verbs in the ATC trials could not, as suggested by the findings of Study 2, enable listeners to reliably predict the tone of the following word. Consequently, modulations of the N400-like effect were not obtained between the two types of incorrect numbers in the ATC trials in the current study.

That is, failure to detect a/an-elicited N400 effect does not necessarily deny phonological form pre-activation. Alternatively, it could indicate that not all participants use indefinite article a/an to predict the initial phoneme of the head noun. 

### ERP modulations at target words can index lexical pre-activation

Amplitude of the N400-like component was reduced to COR numbers in 3TS trials relative to those in ATC trials. Reduction of the N400-like component could only result from the increased pre-activation level of the expected numbers upon hearing the 3TS cues in the preceding verbs in 3TS trials.

In addition, the differential N400-like effects between IST and IDT numbers in 3TS trials also imply
costs for disconfirmed predictions. 

### Late fronto-central negativities

The late negativity to IDT numbers relative to COR numbers at fronto-central channels in 3TS trials was unexpected. Furthermore, although non-significant, the IST numbers also elicited a late fronto-central negativity relative to COR numbers in 3TS trials, and there was no difference between ERPs to the IDT and IST numbers at those electrodes during that time window. Similarly unexpected, the comparison between ERPs to COR numbers in ATC and 3TS trials also showed a late negativity at fronto-central electrodes in ATC trials relative to 3TS trials regardless of the baseline correction procedure.

In incorrect trials, both the expected number and the encountered incorrect number were stored in working memory. This additional working memory load could trigger the late fronto-central negativity. To explain these unexpected results based on the working memory account, one needs to assume that the COR numbers in 3TS trials somehow required less working memory load compared to numbers in all other conditions. Some participants reported that wu3 and jiu3 were more frequent than others, it is possible that more participants had this illusion during the experiment, and that the two COR numbers in 3TS trials (5 and 9) were consequently the ‘default’ numbers for some participants, thus needing less working memory load.

An alternative interpretation of the late fronto-central negativity to COR numbers in ATC trials relative
to those in 3TS trials is that it was not caused by the critical numbers but rather was due to a sustained differential effect elicited by the preceding verbs. However, this explanation cannot be reconciled with two observations of the current data. First, if the 3TS verbs indeed triggered a positive deflection, then during the LPC window of the critical numbers, ERPs at COR numbers should be more positive in 3TS trials than in ATC trials. Second, if hearing a non-canonical tonal form of the critical verbs would trigger a late fronto-central positivity, this should also be the case for the IST and IDT conditions in 3TS trials.
