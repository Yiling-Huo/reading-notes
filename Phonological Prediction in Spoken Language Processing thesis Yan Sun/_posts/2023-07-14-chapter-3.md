title: 'Chapter 3 Study 1: Anticipatory Tonal Variations in Standard Mandarin'
---

## Methods

### Participants
 
10 native speakers of Standard Mandrin from Beijing. 

### Stimuli

Stimuli follow Shih (2004). Seven digits following the form of 38X-YZ34. Y was the digit under examination, X and Z were contexts. Focus pattern is controlled by eliciting digit strings as answers to questions so that the expected focus was on the following digit Z. 

### Procedure

Each trial was repeated twice, order true randomised. Normal speech rate. 

### Data preparation

Speech files were auto-segmented and labeled using SPPAS (Bigi, 2015) and then segmentation errors were manually corrected. Time-normalized (10-point per syllable) F0 were generated using ProsodyPro in Praat. Extracted F0 values in Hz were then converted into semitones to reduce cross-speaker variations. F and f represent frequency in semitone and Hz respectively.

### Data analysis

Growth curve analysis, a type of curvilinear regression that allows modelling of non-linear shape of F0 contours rather than average F0 values at points of time. In this study, F0 contours of each level of the target tone were modeled separatelyl with a third-order orthogonal polynomial with the fixed effect of following tone on all time terms. and participant and participant-by-following tone random effects on all time terms. Thus, there were three predictors for each time point: Time^1, Time^2, and Time^3 (plus a constant “intercept” term), and the growth curves were a weighted combination of these polynomial curves. The time polynomials were centered and made orthogonal prior to entering the models because they would otherwise be highly correlated, which would make the results difficult to interpret.
