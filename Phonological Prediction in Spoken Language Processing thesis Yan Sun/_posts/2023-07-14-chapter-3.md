title: 'Chapter 3 Study 1: Anticipatory Tonal Variations in Standard Mandarin'
---

## Methods

### Participants
 
10 native speakers of Standard Mandrin from Beijing. 

### Stimuli

Stimuli follow Shih (2004). Seven digits following the form of 38X-YZ34. Y was the digit under examination, X and Z were contexts. Focus pattern is controlled by eliciting digit strings as answers to questions so that the expected focus was on the following digit Z. 

### Procedure

Each trial was repeated twice, order true randomised. Normal speech rate. 

### Data preparation

Speech files were auto-segmented and labeled using SPPAS (Bigi, 2015) and then segmentation errors were manually corrected. Time-normalized (10-point per syllable) F0 were generated using ProsodyPro in Praat. Extracted F0 values in Hz were then converted into semitones to reduce cross-speaker variations. F and f represent frequency in semitone and Hz respectively.

### Data analysis

Growth curve analysis, a type of curvilinear regression that allows modelling of non-linear shape of F0 contours rather than average F0 values at points of time. In this study, F0 contours of each level of the target tone were modeled separatelyl with a third-order orthogonal polynomial with the fixed effect of following tone on all time terms. and participant and participant-by-following tone random effects on all time terms. Thus, there were three predictors for each time point: Time^1, Time^2, and Time^3 (plus a constant “intercept” term), and the growth curves were a weighted combination of these polynomial curves. The time polynomials were centered and made orthogonal prior to entering the models because they would otherwise be highly correlated, which would make the results difficult to interpret. 

### Growth curve analyses results

(Refer to thesis for plots)

3TS resulted in the categorical alternation of tonal form: F0 contour of the first T3 in T3-T3 sequence changed from falling to rising.

Three different types of ATC were attested in growth curve analyses: DR, AR, and AL.

## Discussion

### Dissimilatory raising

DR occurred when T1 T2 and T4 were followed by T2 or T3, the effect of T3 being stronger and more consistent. DR mainly affected the early part of a tone, and its effect is in two ways: (1) if a tone is rising during its early part (T1 and T4), then the velocity of this rising would become higher in anticipation of a following T3 or T2; (2)if a tone first falls and then rises (T2), the falling would become shallower, the minimum turning point would occur earlier, and the rising would have a higher initial velocity in anticipation of a following T3 or T2. 

Xu (1997)'s articulatory account for DR: it might be a strategy to facilitate reaching a low pitch target, which is articulatorily difficult. 

### Assimilatory raising

AR occurred when a tone was followed by T1 or T4, with the effect of T4 being stronger and more consistent. AR primarily affected the late part of a tone. There are three types: (1) T1 would rise in anticipation of a following T4 or T1; (2) T2's velocity of rising would become higher in preparation for T1 or T4; (3) T3 and T4's velocity of falling would become lower, slowing down the falling movement, or even become negative to approach T1 or T4. 

AR could be accounted for by physiological constraints in the prosody generation model Stem-ML (Kochanski and Shih 2003). In connected speech tones need to make smooth connections to their neighbours because of laryngeal muscle movement. 

### Assimilatory lowering

This is less reported in previous research. AL occurred when a tone was followed by T2 or T3, with effect of T3 being stronger and more consistent. T1 would slightly fall, T2 would have negative acceleration, T4's falling velocity would become higher. The cause of AL should be the same as AR. 

### Implications for Study 2

In a word identification task, Qin and Zhang (2022) observed no evidence for the effect of DR cues on Cantonese spoken-word recognition. One possible explanation is that the DR cues may not be salient enough. Study 2 uses AR cues in T4-T4 (the strongest AR) as a test case of ATC to examine its effect on spoken-word recognition in Standard Mandarin.
