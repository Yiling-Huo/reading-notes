title: 'Chapter 4 Study 2: Effects of Anticipatory Tonal Variations on Spoken-Word Recognition and Tonal Prediction'
---

Two visual-world eye-tracking studies, one manipulating 3TS and one ATC. 

## Methods

### Participants

60 native Mandarin speakers, 18 to 25 years. Half completed Exp-3TS before Exp-ATC, half the other way around. 

### Materials

- Participants heard sentence containing a target word and saw four objects. 
- One of the objects is the target, one is a competitor, others are distractors.
- 48 target monosyllabic words, 12 in each tone. 
- Each target appeared in two trials: Diff-tone competitor, Same-tone competitor. 
- 96 trials for each experiment. The 48 words were heard twice in each experiment.

- ***Qing3 nin2 dian3 X*** as carrier sentence in Exp-3TS.
- ***Qing3 nin2 kan4 X*** as carrier sentence in Exp-ATC. 

- (So in diff-tone condition the target is the only word that sandhi cue points to, and in same-tone condition both target and competitor are compatible with cue)

### Procedure

- word-picture association task: training phase and testing phase. 
- 1000ms preview time
- task was to look and click on the correct picture asap. 
- feedback of accuracy? following each trial. 

### Data analysis

Trials with wrong clicks were excluded. 

#### RT

RT is the time from onset of target word to click. Lmer with random effects of subject and fixed effects of target tone (T3, T4), experiment (Exp-3TS, Exp-ATC), competitor type (diff-tone, same-tone) and interactions. 

#### Saccade latencies

Saccade latency is the time from initiation of the first saccade following target word onset that culminated in landing on the target picture. Lmer with random effects of subject and same fixed effects. 

#### Fixation proportions

Proportions of fixations to target and competitor pictures were extracted for each 20-ms bin starting from the onset of the target word to 1000ms post onset. GAMMs models fixation proportions aggregated by participant as a non-linear smooth function over time. 

## Predictions

If 3TS facilitate spoken-word recognition, listeners should recognise T3 targets faster in the Exp-3TS than in Exp-ATC, shown as faster RT, shorter saccade lantencies, and higher fixation proportions to target in Exp-3TS than Exp-ATC. (Why compare two experiments not two types of target within one experiment though??)

If 3TS facilitates spoken-word recognition, fixation proportions to the same-tone competitors between Exp-3TS and Exp-ATC should be different when target is T3. (Again why not compare same-tone with different-tone condition??)

If ATC facilitates word recognition, the same patterns would happen with T4 targets. 

## Results

### RT

![eye-tracking-rt](/reading-notes/img/sun-yan-thesis/eye-tracking-rt.png)

When target is T3, listeners clicked on target pictures slower in Exp-ATC than Exp-3TS, regardless of same vs diff-tones. When target is T4, listeners clicked on target slower in Exp-ATC than Exp-3TS, significant in diff-tone, marginal in same-tone. 

### Saccade latencies

![eye-tracking-saccade](/reading-notes/img/sun-yan-thesis/eye-tracking-saccade.png)

When target is T3, first look to target is faster in 3TS than ATC, regardless of same vs. diff-tones. No difference when target is T4. 

### Fixation proportions

#### Fixation proportion on target

![eye-tracking-proportion](/reading-notes/img/sun-yan-thesis/eye-tracking-proportion.png)

Small effect of Experiment when target is T3. Small effect of same vs diff-tone. 

GAMMs were run separately for T3- and T4-targets. The formula for the T3-target model is as follows:
Target.P ∼ competitor + IsDIFF.3TS + IsSAME.3TS + s(Time, by=competitor) + s(Time, by=IsDIFF.3TS) + s(Time, by=IsSAME.3TS) + s(Time, Subject, by=competitor, bs=‘fs’, m=1)

In this formula, the predictors in the first line act as parametric terms, modeling an overall height difference
among different levels of each predictor. Predictors in the second line are smooth functions (SFs), each setting up a (potentially) non-linear smoothing over Time separately for each level of the variable introduced by
‘by=’. Finally, subject-related random effects were taken into account via a factor smooth (hence, the bs=‘fs’ notation) using the last line of the formula.

Significant difference in target fixation proportions between the two experiment for both competitor types, suggesting overall higher fixation proportion on targets in Exp-3TS than Exp-ATC.

There are also more fixations to the same-tone competitor in Exp-3TS than Exp-ATC when the target is T3. 

## Discussion

Results show that in Exp-3TS, listeners clicked on T3 targets faster, initiated eye movements towards the target earliers, and fixated on the target more, compared with Exp-ATC. Same tone competitor was also more likely to be fixated on in Exp-3TS than Exp-ATC. Indicates that listeners used 3TS cues in the pre-target word to predict the tone of the target. 

No evidence for ATC facilitating spoken-word recognition. But some margnial effect that T4 same-tone competitors were more fixated in ATC than 3TS.
