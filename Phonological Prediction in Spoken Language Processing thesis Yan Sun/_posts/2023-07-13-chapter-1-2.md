# Introduction

## Background and Research Goals

Contemporary theories of language processing often view prediction as an important mechanism of language comprehension. 

There is less consensus about whether the phonological form of expected words can also be pre-activated. 

No effect at English a/an could mean that people still pre-activated noun phonological form but simply failed to reliably associate it with a/an because of potential adjectives. 

The N400 pre-activation vs. integration debate. 

# Literature Review

## Anticipatory Tonal Variations in Standard Mandarin

When produced in continuous speech, the surface F0 contours of the four full lexical tones and T0 are subject to variations depending on the surrounding tonal context. 

### Third-tone sandhi in Standard Mandarin

3TS leads to the situation where sandhi-T3 and canonical T2 both surface as rising tones and they seem to be neutralized in their realization. 

### Anticipatory tonal coarticulation in Standard Mandarin

The production of a tone is affected by the anticipation of a following tone. It differs from 3TS in that ATC is a gradient phonetic effect and highly variable, whereas 3TS results in phonological alternation and demonstrates more consistency. 

Two types of ATC: dissimilatory (high before low) and assimilatory (high before high). Velocity of falling is different for dissimilatory and assimilatory ATC. 

## Anticipatory Coarticulation in Spoken-Word Recognition

All words that match temporarily with the incoming signal may compete for recognition, and the word that receives the most support is most likely to be recognized. 

Spoken word recognition is further complicated by the variability of sounds in connected speech due to influences from neighboring sounds (coarticulation). Lack of invariance problem in speech production. Listener may take advantage of coarticulation to anticipate upcoming speech sounds. 

### Effects of anticipatory segmental coarticulation on spoken-word recognition

Gow and McMurray (2007) showed eye tracking evidence that coarticulation such as green boat vs green bank can help fixations to the correct referent. (Evidence comes from fixations to the target before 200ms post target onset, not necessarily from stats between conditions??) Other eye-tracking evidence from Tobin et al (2010) and Salverda et al (2014). 

### Effects of anticipatory tonal coarticulation on spoken-word recognition

Qin and Zhang (2022) use of ATC cues in Cantonese spoken-word recognition used a word identification task. Dissimilatory effects did not seem to help Cantonese speakers in spoken word recognition. 

## Phonological Form Pre-activation in Predictive Language Processing

### ERP evidence for predictive language processing

N400's association with semantic feature overlap with expected. 

Prenominal mismatch paradigm, e.g. Van Berkum 2005. But ERP elicited by prenominal mismatch words varied with respect to time-course, scalp distribution and even polarity.

### Debate on phonological form pre-activation in predictive language processing

Phonological form pre-activation elicited early negative ERP modulation: N200 (Van den Brink 2001), N250 (Hagoort and Brown 2000), or phonological mismatch negativity (PMN, Connolly and Phillips 1994). E.g. Connolly and Phillips found N200 differential detectable only when the initial phoneme of the presented word differed from that of the predicted word, whereas an N400 differential was detectable only when the received word was semantically anomalous in the sentence context. 

The debate between Delong and Nieuwland (and others). Different possibility. First is difference in experiment design such as trial number and filler items. The second is difference among groups of participants such as the number of participants, language cultural backgrounds, comprehension accuracy etc. Most likely possibility is unlike gender/animacy, a/an does not agree with the noun, but only indicate the initial phoneme of the next word. 

### Can ERP modulations at target words index lexical pre-activation?

"It was difficult to understand the visiting professor. Like many foreigners he spoke with an accent/a lisp/an apron". Apron's N400 is enhanced compared with lisp (with a as a pre-target cue).
