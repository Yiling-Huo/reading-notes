Given current evidence, two predictions appear to be true:
- There is no specific cost when an unpredictable word is encountered in a context where another word is predictable
- the function relating predictability to processing difficulty is logarithmic, not linear

- conditional probability is the causal bottleneck mediating all effects on incremental processing difficulty?
- conditional probability does not account for the difficulty of low-frequency word or garden path disambiguation.

## Introduction

- effects of predictability on processing difficulty in incremental language processing

Surprisal theory ([Levy 2008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2007.05.006), [Hale 2001](https://aclanthology.org/N01-1021.pdf))
- the difficulty in processing an input word is determined by that word's conditional probability given its preceding context
- processing difficulty is a linear function of the word's negative log probability (surprisal). 
- relationship arises because a comprehender maintains and continuously updates a belief about a probability distribution over all possible sentences. 
- processing difficulty = the extend to which probability mass is shifted/pruned away upon encountering the input word

Difference between classic psycholinguistics and surprisal theory: process of comprehension
- psycholinguistics: putative substages - lexical access, syntactic analysis, ...
- surprisal theory: eliminating all but the correct representation from a set of possible representations

Weaker and stronger versions of surprisal theory
- weaker surprisal theory: language comprehension is probabilistic inference + different processing stages. 
- stronger surprisal theory: conditional probability is the causal bottleneck mediating all effects on incremental processing difficulty. 

Predictions from surprisal theory:
- it should not matter whether another word is more predictable - no prediction violation cost
- the function relating predictability to processing difficulty should be logarithmic rather than linear

- Evidence supports the two predictions, and
- *it's not compatible with the pre-activation approach of N400*

- (weak) surprisal as a better theory of predictability effects than lexical preactivation, but it does not support probabilistic inference as a complete theory of incremental language comprehension.
