- L1 metrical structure's influence on L2 words
    - foot structure difference in German vs. English of romance borrow words
- cross-modal fragment priming EEG experiment
- behavioural and ERP results show effects of 
    - native phonology
    - loan status (L2 only vs. L1-L2 sharing)
- RT
    - nonshared loanwords > shared loan words
    - 1 foot > 2 feet in two types of loan words
- ERPs
    - N400 effect of L2-only loan words (1 foot)

- L1 German metrical phonology guides L2 English processing of shared loan words
