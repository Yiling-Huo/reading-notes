## Abstract

- face perception is unique due to an obligatory detection process

## Introduction

### Detection

- the most basic aspect of face perception
- a simple template-like process (can detect T-shape schematic faces)
- detection (extracting what's common to all faces) vs. recognition (extract how each face differ from another)
- detection: domain-specific filter, recognition is only engages once face is detected
- detection automatically accomplishes segmentation (isolating face from background)

### Measurement and categorization

- once face is detected, it must be measured to allow identification
- zero-sum game between measurement and classification

## Computer vision algorithms

- Viola & Jones (2004) feature detectors, increasingly complex filters
- Sinha (2002) qualitative contrast relationships between different parts of a face are highly conserved
- information theory approach - identifying fragments

- all use basic feature detectors


- Rutk & Pentland (1991) eigenface algorithm - common basic features of faces (round, smooth, symmetric, two eyes, a nose, and a mouth), principle components analysis (PCA)
- Jebara (2003) - triple representation, each pixel conveys image intensity value and location, allow for different scale of faces


- Separating the process of measurement from the process of classification gives a computational system maximum flexibility

- if detection precedes measurement, then the detector can determine the location, size, and rotation angle of the eyes and fact outline and then use those to normalize the input to face measurement units. 

- Detection and recognition are distinct processes

## Human behavior and functional imaging

- recognition performance drops substantially when faces are presented upside down or in negative contrast
- only upright,, positive-contrast faces gain access to the face-processing system?

### Norm-based coding

- faces are represented in terms of their deviation from the norm, or average, face - Caricatured faces are often more identifiable than veridical photographs
-  face identity aftereffect was interpreted as indicating that adaptation to a given face shifts the norm or average face in the direction of the adapting face, making faces on the opposite side of the norm more distinctive

### Detection

- efficient to separate detection and recognition and to have detection precede recognition because detection can act as a domain-specific filter to make the recognition process more efficient
- a face-specific processing system that can be accessed only by upright faces, present in CK and absent in prosopagnosics.
