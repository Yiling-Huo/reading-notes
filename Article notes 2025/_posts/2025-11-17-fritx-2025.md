- ERP fragment priming study with Bengali-English bilinguals (native Bengali speakers who started learning English at relatively young ages)
- lexical decision task in english, response to english word that are also in Bengali vs. that are not
- RTs showed loan words did not affect priming
- Different ERP components for loan type (1 foot vs. 2 feet)

- 32 electrodes ActiCap
- auditory fragment prime (first syllable of target word) and visual target
- ISI 250ms
- target presented 500ms
- (unclear whether participants might have already started responding during target presentation)
- ROI analysis
    - left anterior: FCx, Fz, FC1, FC5, F3, F7, Fp1
    - centro-parietal (Cz, CPz, Pz, P4, P3, CP1, CP2)
- window analysis
    - mixed effects linear regression with each 100ms window increment (mean voltages for each ROI)
