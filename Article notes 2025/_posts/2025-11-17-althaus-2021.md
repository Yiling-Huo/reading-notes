- Due to small number of minimal pairs, pitch accent in Swedish is less relevant for comprehension (than lexical tones)
- Which gives rise to the question of whether pitch accent in Swedish facilitates lexical access
- Across two experiments, Swedish native speakers use tonal accent in lexical access
- Mismatching accents fail to prime semantically related targets, regardless of whether primes had accent competitors (possible minimal pairs in the language) or not. 
- Early bilinguals showed similar facilitation as monolinguals

# Introduction

- cross-modal fragment semantic priming task
- priming a target for a visual lexical decision task with an auditory first-syllable prime fragment (e.g. first syllable of pony to prime horse)

## Suprasegmental information in lexical access

- stress in English
- lexical tones in Mandarin and Cantonese
- pitch accent in Japanese (similar to Swedish)

## Suprasegmental processing in bilinguals

- Early bilinguals with dominant target language show similar patterns to monolinguals, but early bilinguals with weak target language show similar paters to late bilinguals
- better tonal discrimination/identification in tonal language speakers than non-tonal language speakers
- early bilinguals (11 months) show tonal sensitivity to tonal native language while retain flexibility in the non-tonal native language (e.g. Mandarin-English bilinguals)
- bidialectal speakers (Mandarin-dialect) are less sensitive to tonal information in VWE (Wiener, Seth & Kiwako Ito. 2015)

## swedish pitch accent

- Felder et al. (2009) : role of pitch accent in word identification.

## This study

- cross-modal priming paradigm
- target: visual
- prime: auditory (first syllable of a related word)
- 500ms SOA

- no difference between monolingual swedish speakers and early bilingual swedish speakers who grew up in sweden.
