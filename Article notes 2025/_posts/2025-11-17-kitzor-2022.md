- cross-modal forced-choice experiments
- auditory primes (CV segments of CVC words) with visual full-word targets
- hypothesis: only unpredictable nasalisation is stored and it governs how listeners interpret vowel nasality. 
- CV(nasal)C primes produced faster reaction times and fewer errors than CVC or CVN primes. 
- nasal vowels are specified for nasality: comprehenders interpret nasal vowels as underlying, rather than immediately considering contextual nasalisation (CVN)

# Introduction

- theories on lexical representations
    - which information is stored for any given word in the mental lexicon (detailed vs. parsimonious)
    - which information is extracted from the speech signal to access the mental representations
        - articulatory events, phonemes, features. 
- nasal feature: privative ([nasal] - []) or equipollent ([+nasal] - [-nasal])
- whether listeners distinguish between contextually nasalised vowels (CVN) and underlying nasal vowel (CVC). 
- are listeners more likely to interpret a nasalised vowel as underlying than assimilation when a language (e.g. Bengali) has both

- earlier works on Bengali suggest that nasal feature is privative, and contextual nasalisation is not stored in mental lexicon
