## Intro

- "inner voice" speech-like: segmental phonological information, prosody, paralinguistic such as voice quality and speech tempo
- linguistic rhythm that emerges from the implicit stress patterns of the word sequence
- readers mentally construct patterns of implicit lexical prominences, which evolve from the concatenation of individual words
- when temporal syntactic ambiguity, readers preferably generate a parse that conforms to rhythmic well-formedness principles. 
    - initial stages of the syntactic parsing process are sensitive to the local prosodic environment even in the written modality

### Stress and linguistic rhythm in auditory language

- each syllable has one main stress
- stressed syllables are lengthened and may be realised with higher pitch
- hierarchical stress:
    - lexical stress
    - prosodic phrase
    - nuclear accent n a sentence
- assignment of phrasal and sentential stress is mainly determined by the syntactic structure and the discourse context

- English and German prefer alternation of strong and weak syllables
- avoidance of stress clashes
    - affects language production
        - deviation from citation stress
        - favor stress pattern that maximizes rhythmic alternation in pseudo words
        - speakers preferably use syntactic constructions that prevent a stress clash
- language comprehension
    - listeners analyse the same lexically ambiguous syllable sequence differently depending on the linguistic rhythm (trochaic or iambic) established by th preceding context. [Dilley McAuley 2008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jml.2008.06.006) [Niebuhr 2009](https://doi.org/10.1159/000208933)
    - phonetic rhythm has a guiding function in speech perception, in that it makes upcoming material predictable
    - perception of stress shift on critical words augments the cues to upcoming phrase boundaries even before the boundary is encountered (stress shift = phrase boundary?) [Warrent, Grabe, Nolan 1995](https://doi.org/10.1080/01690969508407112)

### Prosody in reading

- prosodic processing in silent reading [Ashby at al 2005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2004.12.006).
    - words with two stress (situation) read longer than one (authority)
    - ERP evidence for prosodic phonological representation < 100ms after onset [Ashby at al 2008](https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/0096-1523.34.1.224)
- if implicit prosody is speech-like, then it should also undergo stress shift and linguistic rhythm and preference for stress alternation.

### Implicit prosody in written sentence comprehension

- silent prosody affects syntactic analysis
    - ambiguous sentences induce stronger difficulty when the alternative analysis differ in prosody
    - noun-verb homographs (present - present) affects resolution of syntactic ambiguities in silent reading
    - readers posit syntactic clause boundaries in temporarily ambiguous sentences based on the length of the preceding constituent
- at least a partial syntactic analysis of the critical words and phrases is required in order for implicit prosody to show its effects on written sentence comprehension

- reading prosody depends on a partial syntactic analysis of the text

- if prosody is immediately available during processing (e.g. < 100ms), then stress and linguistic rhythm should exert their influence from the very beginning of the parsing process.

## Experiments 

- in face of an ambiguous structure that involves a stress clash in one reading but not the other, there should be a preference for the version without stress clash

- German phrasal and lexical stress
- text have two readings depending on whether the word mehr has stress (temporal adverb or compliment of verb)
- the word following mehr can have initial stress (stress clash) or medial stress (no clash)

### Results

- general preference for temporal reading
- difference between the two compliment reading
    - mehr + initial stress verb created more reading cost

## General discussion

- once the reader encounters the ambiguous word mehr, they commit first to the temporal unaccented reading and reanalyse only when forced by syntactic counter-evidence
- prosodic reanalysis forces implicit accentuation of mehr and thus induce the rhythmically imperfect stress clash representation in condition compliment-initial, which would cause the additional increase in processing costs

- readers have the necessary information for evaluating potential stress clashes as soon as the critical words are combined within the reader's processing window (before the evaluation of the disambiguating material)
- or, reader expect a continuation compatible with the unaccented temporal interpretation, and face integration difficulties when the disambiguation region forces the comparative interpretation of mehr
