- Tested repetition suppression (fMRI adaptation) for two orthogonal dimensions of sentence complexity
- Embedding position (right-branching vs. center-embedding)
- Movement type (subject vs. object)

- Found syntactic adaptation in Broca's area
- Adaptation is structured: <span style="background-color:paleturquoise;">BA45 selectively adapted to movement type, BA44 adapted to both movement type and embedding position. </span>

## Intro

- **fMRI adaptation**: a stimulus property, once repeated, yields a suppressed signal, and so helps to identify such properties that a particular brain region processes. If a given region is involved in processing a property X, then repetition of X results in a lower fMRI signal recorded in that region. 
- In the present study, X takes the form of two types of syntactic complexity:
    - word-order canonicity (syntactic movement)
    - place of embedding

- We show syntactic adaptation in Broca's area.
- This region is functionally subdivided along these syntactic complexity dimensions.
- The anterior portion of Broca's area (and only this part) is syntactically selective, as it adapts to one complexity dimension (canonicity/movement type) but not the other (embedding). 

- Support for anterior Broca's area having highly specific role in sentence processing. 

Psycho- and Neuro-linguistics have operationalised the concept of syntactic complexity: sentence types whose comprehension is more difficult (longer processing time, more errors) are more complex than others. Complex sentences are typically created by embedding sentences within others. 

## Methods

### Design

![design](/reading-notes/img/articles-phd/santi-2010-1.jpg)

- **Embedding**: embedded relative clauses that modify the subject of the main clause intervene between the main subject and its predicate, which maintain agreement dependency. 
- **Canonicity/movement**: there must be a link between the relative head, the relative pronoun, and the empty position to guarantee that we interpret the head in the correct theta role. This link is short in the canonical word order, but long in the non-canonical word order (object movement). 

The four conditions contain identical set of words, and different syntactic properties lead to different meanings and different processing difficulties. Dominant current psycholinguistics approach to syntactic complexity (Working Memory account) collapsed these two different sources of complexity. But question is whether these two orthogonal dimensions are separable neurally. Lesion studies suggest a distinction may exist: evidence from Broca's aphasia distinguishes between the dimensions of complexity of relative clauses. 

This experiment repeated sentences which were either the same or different along the two complexity dimensions. Each stimulus consisted of a 2-sentence sequence, which differed along zero, one, or two of the complexity dimensions. Four conditions: Same Movement Same Embedding, Different Movement Different Embedding, Same Movement Different Embedding, Different Movement Different Embedding.

Reduced BOLD signal is expected in a given voxel whenever it considers the 2 sentences as Same. 

### Procedure

Participant's task was to identify whether 1 or 2 nouns changed from the first to the second sentence of every trial. 

- i. The waitress [who the lawyer is smiling at _] is Dianna
- ii. The witness [who the lawyer is smiling at _] is Dianna

## Results

- **Anterior LIFG (BA45) adapted to movement but not embedding.**
- **No region adapted to embedding but not movement.**
- **Posterior LIFG (BA44) right inferior precentral sulcus (RiPS), and left superior temporal gyrus (STG) adapted to both embedding and movement.**

## Discussion

- "left Brodmann Area 45 specializes in calculating Movement relations during sentence comprehension, whereas no particular brain area specializes in handling Embedding."
- "a distinct set of brain areas participates in analyzing sentences that are syntactically complex along both dimensions (i.e., the left posterior STG, and to a lesser extent right iPS, and left Brodmann Areas 44/6/8)."

- "We note that it is possible however, that the left posterior STG, right iPS and left BA 44/6/8 were adapting to sentence-level (compositional) semantics since sentential meaning was preserved more in the identical condition than the other three conditions (it is impossible to preserve compositional semantics given the syntactic modifications under investigation)."
