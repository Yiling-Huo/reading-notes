## Design

2x3 design: T2*/T3/T4 vs. focus/background (information structure)

Terms:
- Pre-sandhi: T3
- Post-sandhi: T2*
- Mispronunciation: T4

**NB: sentence and discourse context is not very constraining (thus no N400).**

## Results

ERP at critical word (cai): Different P600s (cai4>cai3>cai2), no N400 effect in any conditions.

"Unexpectedly, at the background position, the mispronunciation condition still elicited an LPC effect, while the pre-sandhi condition didn’t elicit any significant ERP effect. "
