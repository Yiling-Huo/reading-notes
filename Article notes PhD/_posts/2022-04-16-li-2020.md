## ERP analysis:

- Epoch -100-1000ms
- Artifact analysis
    "To investigate the integration processing of critical nouns, analyses were time-locked to the onset of the nouns. To examine the potential anticipatory processing of critical nouns prior to their acoustic onset, analyses were time-locked to the onset of the critical verbs. We analyzed how the ERP amplitude at the verbs was associated with the easiness of integrating these verbs into the preceding context and the forthcoming critical nouns’ predictability. The Fieldtrip toolbox for MATLAB (Oostenveld, Fries, Maris, & Schoffelen, 2011) was used to preprocess the EEG data and calculate ERPs. The raw EEG data were first filtered with a band-pass filter 0.1–40 Hz. Then, ocular artifacts were isolated using independent component analysis and removed by projecting the data onto the pseudoinverse of the artifact components. These ocular-artifact-corrected data were divided into epochs ranging from 100 ms before the onset of the critical words to 1000 ms after the onset of these words. A time window of 100 ms preceding the onset of the critical words was used for baseline correction. Subsequently, trials contaminated by muscle artifacts, electrode drifting, amplifier saturation, or other artifacts were identified by semiautomatic artifact rejection (automatic criterion: signal amplitude exceeding ± 75 μV, followed by a manual check). Trials containing artifacts mentioned above were rejected. The ANOVA test with conditions (six levels) as independent factors showed that there was no significant difference in the rejected trials from the six experimental conditions at both nouns (F(5,115) = 1.38, p = .249) (8.7% [SD = 5.4], 6.6% [SD = 4.6], 9.0% [SD = 7.0], 7.0% [SD = 6.6], 8.8% [SD = 6.1], and 8.0% [SD = 7.7] for Beijing-Strong, Beijing-Weak, Dalian-Strong, Dalian-Weak, Jiaozuo-Strong, and Jiaozuo-Weak conditions, respectively) and verbs (F(5,115) = 1.20, p = .315) (8.0% [SD = 6.8], 8.5% [SD = 5.3], 10.6% [SD = 7.3], 9.6% [SD = 7.0], 9.8% [SD = 6.4], and 9.6% [SD = 8.4] for Beijing-Strong, Beijing-Weak, Dalian-Strong, Dalian-Weak, Jiaozuo-Strong, and Jiaozuo-Weak conditions, respectively). Finally, averages were computed for each participant, each condition, and at each electrode site before grand averages were calculated across all participants."
	
## Statistical analysis:

- Initial: Cluster-based random permutation test, "To examine whether the manipulation of Semantic Constraint (strong vs. weak) elicited a significant ERP effect and how it interacted with Dialect (home, FA regional, vs. UN regional), a cluster-based random permutation test was conducted within 0–600 ms post-word onset (in steps of 2 ms) over forty-seven electrodes. This permutation test (implemented in FieldTrip, Maris & Oostenveld, 2007) computes a separate t-test at every time point for every electrode site and uses a cluster method to correct for multiple comparisons. It is a good option to control the overall Type I error rate when no a priori information is available to guide the choice of latency windows and electrode sites (Luck & Gaspelin, 2017). "
- Narrower window & region: linear mixed effects model
    Two step lmm analysis: "The linear mixed-effects model analyses were conducted in two steps: first categorical analysis and then continuous analysis. Both types of analysis were conducted separately for verbs and nouns. The categorical analyses were conducted first to facilitate model convergence and to follow the present experiment design. Two factors Semantic Constraint (strong vs. weak) and Dialect (home, FA regional, vs. UN regional) were modeled as categorical predictors on both the target nouns and their preceding transitive verbs. This type of analysis aimed to further examine the effect of Semantic Constraint and its interaction with Dialect by simultaneously modeling other potentially confounding factors (e.g., word frequency, number of strokes of nouns, and acoustic parameters) and the variance associated with each subject and each item. If the main or simple main effect of Semantic Constraint reached significance in the above analyses, a further continuous analysis of single-trial data was conducted to examine the exact reasons for this Semantic Constraint effect at the target nouns and the preceding transitive verbs using continuous independent variables (obtained in the pretests). At the verbs, the factor Semantic Constraint was closely associated with (1) the verbs’ semantic congruency (indicated by the values of the verb congruency pretest), (2) the preceding context (indicated by the values of the cloze1 pretest and the values of verb cloze probability), and (3) the predictability of forthcoming critical nouns after the presence of these verbs (indicated by the values of the cloze2 pretest). Here, the first factor is related to the easiness of integrating the verbs into the preceding context while the last related to the anticipatory processing of incoming critical nouns. At the target nouns, the factor Semantic Constraint was closely related to both the nouns’ predictability (indicated by the values of cloze3) and semantic congruency (indicated by the values of the noun congruency pretest). "

## Discussion

"Importantly, when the message was spoken in the listeners’ home dialect (i.e., Dalian Mandarin in Experiment 1 and Beijing Mandarin in Experiment 2), the strongly predictable target nouns also elicited a smaller N1 (compared to the weakly predictable ones). It is well known that the N1 component is a robust auditory component and sensitive to the acoustics of individual stimulus (Näätänen & Picton, 1987), especially the acoustic/phonological perceptual features present in the speech signal such as vowels, syllables, and word onsets (Obleser et al., 2004; Parviainen et al., 2005; Sanders & Neville, 2003). "

"we feel it safe to conclude that the N1 reduction effect indicates that in the home dialect condition, a strong-constraint semantic context facilitates the early acoustic/perceptual processing (pre-semantic processing) of the incoming new words. This early facilitating effect is in line with the findings reported in Sohoglu et al. (2012), which demonstrated that the facilitating effect of prior knowledge from matching text (e.g., clay-clay for matching, snail-glass for mismatching, and xxx-haze for neutral) is already present in the early 90–130 ms time window of the following spoken word. The early facilitating effect in our study is also consistent with findings in reading comprehension research that show that sentence/discourse context can facilitate the early processing of visual, orthographic, and grammatical features of upcoming words (e.g., Dikker, Rabagliati, & Pylkkänen, 2009; Federmeier & Kutas, 2001; Kim & Lai, 2012; Lee et al., 2012; Molinaro, Conrad, Barber, & Carreiras, 2010; Penolazzi et al., 2007). Findings in the present study thus extend the early facilitating effect of semantic context constraint on perceptual processing to auditory speech comprehension at the sentence level."

## Conclusion

"This EEG study provided new insights into predictive language processing by showing the effects of three dialect listening conditions (i.e. home dialect, familiar regional dialect, and unfamiliar regional dialect) on anticipatory lexical processing. When our listeners encountered stimuli produced in their home dialect or non-native regional dialect, they showed a significant context-induced lexical predictability effect, reflected in the typical N400 reduction over the predictable target noun processing. However, it was only in the home dialect condition that the context-induced ERP effect was observed during the processing of the transitive verb that precedes the target object noun. The correlation between the ERP amplitudes at the verbs and the predictabilities of the following nouns lends strong support to the anticipatory nature of lexical prediction. Moreover, it was also only in the home dialect condition that an N1 effect was observed on the target noun processing, which indicates that the facilitation effect of semantic context on the processing of incoming new words can occur at the early acoustic/phonological stage of speech processing. The N1 and N400 effects observed at the target nouns jointly confirm that language experience modulates the processing stages at which lexical prediction facilitates speech comprehension. The way dialectal experience modulates lexical prediction at the prenominal verbs may be taken as evidence that anticipatory lexical processing involves effortful meaning computation. Our results thus bring further insights to lexical prediction not only in the temporal sense (i.e., the effect of upcoming predictable nouns on preceding verbs) but also in the spatial sense (i.e., top-down effects from the higher semantic level to the lower acoustic/phonological level). "

## My question:
1. Need to know more about N1
2. Why look at the verb too??
    a. "To examine the potential anticipatory processing of critical nouns prior to their acoustic onset, analyses were time-locked to the onset of the critical verbs."
    b. "In summary, results in Experiment 1 showed that at the critical verbs, the strong-constraint condition (relative to the weak-constraint condition) elicited an enhanced positive deflection only when listening to the home dialect (Dalian Mandarin). The amplitude increases of this positivity were significantly correlated with increases in the predictability of forthcoming critical nouns. This correlation effect reached the maximum at the frontal electrodes as indicated by the linear mixed effects regression analysis. "
