- Effect of predictability on reading time

- High powered:
    - SPR experiment N=200+
    - cross-modal picture naming N=36
- meta-analysis of previous reading eye-tracking exps N=218

- Across all three paradigms, robust linear predictability effects
- Contradicting with surprisal account, **consistent with proportional pre-activation account**
