## Methods
### speakers and recordings

"Forty native speakers of Southern British English took part in the experiment. Twenty-six of them were female and 14 were male. Their mean age was 28.7 years, ranging from 19 to 58. Eight speakers were bi- or multilingual, and 25 speakers were from London while the other 15 speakers were from other places in South Britain. The participants had no background in linguistics. The recordings took place at Chandler House, University College London. The acoustic data were recorded on a computer with a Røde NT1 – a microphone using an RME Fireface UC audio interface and sampled at 44.1 kHz, 16 bit."

"Berko-Gleason’s (1958) pseudoword paradigm"

a total of 48 pseudowords

### Pseudoword construction method

"Our pseudowords followed the phonotactic constraints of English (Clements and Keyser 1983) and contained a complex onset consisting of a plosive and an approximant (/pl/, /bl/, /kl/, /gl/, /pr/), and either a short vowel (/ɪ/, /ʌ/), a long vowel (/i:/, /u:/), or a diphthong (/aʊ/, /eɪ/) as nucleus. One half of the pseudo- words had simple codas (/p/, /t/, /k/, /f/), while the other half had an additional voiceless alveolar fricative (/ps/, /ts/, /ks/, /fs/). "

**careful: according to yi xu we need to control for the coarticulation reason for tone change.**

### listing

To keep priming effects to a minimum, pseudowords were split into two groups. Each group consisted of 24 pseudowords, with 12 pseudowords used for mor-phemic S elicitation and 12 pseudowords used for non-morphemic S elicitation. This way we ensured that no single participant encountered a phonologically identical pseudoword as both mono- and multi-morphemic, i.e. no participant was to encounter /glɪps/ as both singular and plural/clitic item. Participants were distributed equally across both groups. Each participant was supposed to produce 12 tokens for each ofthe four types ofS (non-morphemic, plural, is-clitic, has-clitic; 48 tokens overall). To ensure that each pseudoword was elicited within each context, i.e. with each verb for each type of S, 12 pseudorandomized lists were created. The same 12 lists were used for both groups to keep them comparable. Additionally, types of S were alternated in such a way that no type ofS was elicited twice in a row. This was done to keep priming effects to a minimum.

## Procedure

"First, participants were introduced to the idea of a recently discovered far away planet. They were told that the inhabitants of this planet at first might appear bizarre, but engage in activities known to the participants, and not to worry about the unfamiliar names of the creatures. Second, the trial structure was explained, i.e. for each slide there would be pictures and names of alien creatures, a short explanation ofa situation, and a question relevant to the situation which was to be answered aloud. Participants were then told to proceed in a natural pace and to take as much time as necessary to read and understand the aliens’ names as well as the situations. To avoid possible confusion due to the simplicity ofthe task at hand, participants were made to believe that they were part of a control group of an experiment originally designed for children. Before starting practice trials, participants were reminded to use the aliens’ names instead of pronouns when answering. Then, a practice set of four contexts (see Appendix B) was used to familiarize the participants with the experimental procedure itself."

"For each trial, the screen proceeded similarly (see Figure 1 as well as examples (12) to (15)): First, the pertinent pseudoword(s) were introduced. In the stimuli testing the plural, one pseudoword (in its plural form) was introduced, while in the other three conditions two different pseudowords were introduced. In either case, two images (van de Vijver and Baer-Henney 2014) representing the pseudowords were used to create familiarity with the items under investigation. In all cases but plural, two images of different creatures were given, while in plural contexts, two images of the same creature were used. The pseudowords and images were paired randomly across lists to rule out possible confounding effects of appearance, e.g. the bouba/kiki effect (e.g. Fort et al. 2015; Köhler 1929). Second, a context was introduced. Third, a question was given to elicit an answer with the pertinent type of S while the context slowly faded out. The fading out of the question forced the participants not to rely on the reading-aloud ofthe given context. This open format was chosen in order to elicit speech that is as natural as possible. By choosing such an open format one obviously runs the risk of eliciting a large proportion of re- sponses that do not contain the desired forms. This drawback of our design was countered by having a large number of trials and participants. This strategy resulted in a sufficient number of observations. The experiment was carried out in a self-paced fashion; participants were instructed to progress in a contextually appropriate manner and at a speaking rate they considered to be normal."

## Analysis

### labels and measurements

"As a first step, all recordings were manually transcribed on the utterance level. Using the freely available WebMAUS Basic system (Kisler et al. 2017; Schiel 1999), a phonetic transcription and segmentation based on the manual transcription was created. This automated segmentation was then manually checked by six trained annotators using the software Praat (Boersma and Weenink 2020). Boundaries marking the beginning of an item or S were moved to the nearest zero crossing where both spectrogram and waveform indicated the initiation of the gesture for the respective segment, following laid out segmentation criteria based on features of specific sounds as described in the phonetic literature (e.g. Ladefoged 2003). In the case of S, the boundaries were set to the zero crossing closest to the onset and offset ofthe friction visible in the waveform (see Figure 2). Ifa pause followed the S, the boundary was set to the point where the friction of the S dropped to silence. The reliability of the segmentation criteria was verified by trial segmentations, in which it was ensured that all annotators placed boundaries with only very small variations. Each annotator worked on a disjoint set of items; segmentation criteria were regularly re-verified in meetings of the annotators. After the segmentation process, a Praat script was used to extract the item, its phonetic transcription and its duration, as well as the S duration itself. If applicable, the duration of the following pause was also extracted. Additionally, the preceding and the following word were extracted as well."
