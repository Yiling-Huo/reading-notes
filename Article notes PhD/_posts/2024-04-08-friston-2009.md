- Prediction and perceptual categorization as an inference problem that is solved by the brain. 
- The brain models the world as a hierarchy or cascade of dynamical systems that encode causal structure in the sensorium. 

## Intro

- basic idea that the brain tries to infer the causes of sensations, recent emphasis on hierarchical inference and empirical Bayes. 
- generalise this idea to cover dynamics in the world and consider how neural networks could be configured to invert hierarchical dynamical models and deconvolve sensory causes from sensory input. 

## Hierarchical dynamical models

dynamical generative models p(y, V) = p(y | V)p(V) 
 - a likelihood p(y | V) of getting some data, y, given some causes, V = {x, v, theta}
 - priors on those causes p(V).

 - y = g(x, v, theta) + z
 - x_dot = f(x, v, theta) + w

 - f and g are non-linear functions of the states parametrized by theta.
