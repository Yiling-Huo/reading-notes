## Defining the speed-accuracy trade-off

- accuracy decreases, and decision times increase, with task difficulty (difference between evidence for one alternative over others)
- SAT refers to chages in the speed and accuracy of decisions *for a given task difficulty*. 
- over longer timescales, the SAT may be accomplished by adaptive mechanisms that extract a balance between the speed and accuracy of decisions in order to maximize reward over a block of trials. 
- in contrast, experimental subjects often learn to respond to speed or accuracy conditions from trial to trial, according to a pre-trial cue. (in many experiments, switching between speed and accuracy modes is needed on a trial basis), which needs additional mechanisms to associate the cues with the appropriate mode, and to switch between modes on cue. 

## The bounded integration framework

- evidence for each alternative of a decision is integrated until the running total for one of the alternatives reaches a critetion level. 
- the bound refers to the criterion and integration refers to the accumulation of evidence. 
- the accumulated evidence for a given alternative is referred to as a decision variable. 

- race models: evidence for each choice is integrated independently from the others
- diffusion models: evidence for each choice serves as evidence against the others. 
- accumulator models: decision variables for the respective alternatives are subtracted from one another according to a scaling parameter or weight. In 2-choice tasks, the weight of subtraction can effectively interpolate between the independent race model and the diffusion model (it controls the strength of competition between accumulators).

in this paper:
- integration refers to the accumulation of evidence in continuous time. 
- the benefits of integration depend on the timescale of noise correlations.
- only consider unbiased tasks (prior probability of each alternative is equal). 

### Interpreting bounded integrator models

- the starting point of a decision variable is commonly equated with the baseline (pre-trial) level of integrator activity and the bound is commonly equated with the level of this activity at the time of commitment to a choice. 
- increasing activity by target-in neurons and suppressed activity by target-out neurons have been interpreted as revealing competitive interactions between neural decision variables
- competing accumulator models can also have parameters governing leakage and recurrent excitation of decision variables. 
- integration times (longer than neural currents) are believed to require recurrent excitation provided by synaptic connectivity within a population of excitatory neurons responsive to a given alternative. 

- noisy evidence - response by populations of sensory (and sensory-association) neurons to stimuli in perceptual tasks.
- temporal integration = the buildup activity of neural populations receiving projections from sensory neurons
- the starting point of a decision variable = the activity of integrator populations at the time of evidence onset
- the bound = the rate of integrator activity at the time of commitment to a choice.
