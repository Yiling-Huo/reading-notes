## Abstract

- Traditionally: N1 respond to repeated stimulation and MMN respond to changes in repetitive aspects of auditory stimulation.
- This study: MMN is generated as a result of differential adaptation of anterior and posterior auditory cortex N1 sources by preceding auditory stimulation. Early (-85ms) neural activity within posterior auditory cortex is adapted as sound novelty decreases.
- Difference between N1 and MMN source loci is created by alteration in center of gravity shift, not really two sources.
- Suggest transient adaptation of feature-specific neurons within human posterior auditory cortex filters superfluous sounds from entering awareness.

## Intro

- Novelty needs to be gated to awareness in a fast bottom-up manner. Novel sounds are preattentively gated to awareness based on their degree of physical difference to preceding sensory input.
- Previous EEG and MEG studies suggest two distinct auditory cortex processed underlie preattentive gating of novel sounds to awareness. First N1 - 100ms with repeated stimulation is thought to reflect short-lived adaptation of auditory cortex neurons. Second, MMN with change at - 100-200ms is presumed to reflect relatively automatic comparison of incoming sounds to putative auditory cortex sensory-memory representations that encode repetitive aspects of the auditory environment. 
- Alternative model: the MMN is elicited by a novel sound because preceding auditory stimuli transiently adapt feature-specific auditory cortex neurons. The N1 response to the superfluous (nonnovel) sounds Is delayed and suppressed as a function of its similarity to the preceding auditory events, thus giving rise to the classic MMN. 
- This study hypothesis: 1. robust MMN is elicited by a novel stimulus even after a single preceding standard stimulus when the internovel interval is kept fixed while varying the number of preceding standard stimuli. 2. the posterior N1 source is more robustly adapted than the anterior N1 source by preceding standard stimuli, and that this explains the previously reported differences in the center of gravity of N1 and MMN source loci.

## Exp 2, 3, 4 
- 2: MEG and EEG 
- 3: visual reaction task, measure RT affected by sound 
- 4: fMRI
- Novel sounds with or without standard sounds
- Novel-standard either 1, 2, or 4 octaves different than standard

## Results
### EEG
#### Exp 1

- MMN more robust after a single than after two to four preceding standard stimuli.

#### Exp 2

- Amplitudes to novel stimuli by 1 or 2 octaves from standard were suppressed in novel with standard than novel without standard
- Delayed peak latencies for 1 octave difference in the novel sounds with standards condition.
- Responses to novel sounds separated by 4 octaves from standard were identical with or without standard sound. 

### MEG
#### Exp 2

- More anterior loci in novel sounds with standards than novel sound without standards. However no effect at 4 octave.
- More anterior loci were observed in novel sounds with standards than without standards.
- Amplitude of posterior N1 response was rapidly suppressed with decreasing sound novelty
- Amplitude of anterior N1 response was not affected.

### RT
#### Exp 3

- Novel sounds by 1 octave from standard induced significantly less distraction in novel sounds with standards than without standards. 
- Novel stimuli separated from standard by 4 octaves caused similar distraction with or without standard.

### fMRI 
#### Exp 4

- Bold signal increases in novel sounds with standards did not significantly exceed the sum of activations caused by standard and novel stimuli when presented in isolation. Suggest that MMN is not generated by separate change-specific auditory cortex neurons.

## Discussion

- Recent computational modeling suggested that MMN is an N1 response suppressed and delayed by stimulus specific adaptation.
- This study found robust MMN even with 1 standard preceding, because it used constant novel-to-novel interval.
- EEG data suggest MMN arises through adaptation of N1 activity, rather than being generated by independent auditory cortex sources. Responses to novel sounds separated by 4 octaves from standard were identical of whether the novel stimuli were preceded by standard stimuli. The convergence of the waveforms, suggests that MMN arises through stimulus-specific adaptation of N1 activity.

<p></P>

- Previous MEG showed that N1 is generated by two auditory cortex sources that partly overlap in time: an early posterior and a late anterior source dominating the ascending and descending aspects of the response.
- The amplitude of the posterior N1 source was rapidly suppressed with decreasing sound novelty (from 4 octave to 1 octave), but the amplitude of anterior N1 source was less affected. Suggest that neurons generating the **anterior N1 source are more narrowly tuned on sound frequency than the neurons underlying the posterior N1 source** (anterior source respond to sounds that are even slightly different from standard). 
- **The anterior N1 response was also robustly increased in latency as a function of decreasing sound novelty** (the smaller the difference, the slower the anterior N1). Suggest that it might in fact correspond to the classic MMN response customarily recorded to very small changes in sound frequency. 
- RT data show that degree to which unattended novel sounds distracted visual forces-choice task coincided well with the extent that the posterior N1 response was uninhibited with increasing sound novelty. Suggest that adaptation of the **posterior N1 response serves as the preattentive gating mechanism that determines the extent to which unattended novel sounds enter the subjects awareness**. 

**The results suggest that neurons within posterior auditory cortex are more broadly tuned on sound frequency than those within the anterior auditory cortex. Thus, their responses to subsequent stimuli that are close in sound frequency (low in novelty) are robustly suppressed (the posterior source ignores similar sounds?). Processing of sounds with low novelty value is significantly delayed within the anterior auditory cortex. In contrast, a highly novel sound enters consciousness via stimulating unadapted feature-specific neurons within the posterior auditory cortex.**
