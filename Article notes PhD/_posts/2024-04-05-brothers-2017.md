- N400 and PNP affected by top-down comprehension goals.
- Readers were sensitive to the validity of predictive cues across environments.

## Exp 1

- reading ERP
- predictable vs unpredictable target words
- instructed to read vs. to read and try to predict the last word (and respond whether they predicted correctly)

- N400 of low cloze > moderate cloze.
- PNP of low cloze > moderate cloze (frontal electrodes).
- N400 difference between low-moderate in prediction task > comprehension task.
- PNP difference in prediction task > comprehension task.

- Effect of prediction accuracy: N400 predicted < unpredicted < low cloze; difference peak unpredicted-predicted earlier than low-medium cloze. 

## Exp 2

- self-paced reading
- overall validity of predictive cues manipulated between subjects: high vs. medium vs. low validity groups.

- reading times: validity x predictability interaction: predictability effects more pronounced in high > medium > low group (linearly).
