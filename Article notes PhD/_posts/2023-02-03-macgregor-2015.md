## Abstract 

- Homonymy: words that share a lexical form but have unrelated meanings (e.g., coach (of bus) coach (person))
- Polysemy: meanings are related (e.g., mouth (of person) mouth (of cave))
- Unbalanced homonymy: frequency difference between meanings (coach)
- Balanced homonymy: no frequency different between meanings (match)
- Metaphorical polysemy: meanings derived from metaphor (usually has frequency difference) (mouth)
- Metonymic polysemy: both meanings are literal (usually balanced frequency) (paper)

- Visual single-word priming delayed lexical decision task, long ISI 750ms
- N400 response: targets following homonymous primes show no effects of prime on N400; targets following polysemous primes show effect of prime on N400, for both dominant and subordinate meanings. 

## Intro

Traditionally, loads of behavioural and neuro imaging experiments show that polysemy and homonymy are represented differently in mind. Main conclusion is that meanings for polysemy are facilitatory (different meanings reinforce each other), and for homonymy, because meanings are less related, it is inhibitory (meanings compete with each other). There are some proposal of this being about relatedness of meaning, and shows that even in polysemy when the meanings have long distances there can be competition. 

## This study

There was a previous study that did the same thing with short SOA 50ms. The previous study found prime effect for both meanings for homonymy as well as polysemy; indicating at short time interval, all meanings of ambiguous words are activated. However, under the account that polysemy is facilitatory while homonymy is inhibitory, as time goes on, homonymic meanings should decay as a result of competition, and polysemic meanings should retain. Thus the same study was done at longer ISI 750ms to investigate. 

In design, different types of homonymy and polysemy are distinguished, but not in discussion as there was not much differences found for the main research question. 

## Methods

2 x 3: Prime (homonymy vs polysemy) x target (dominant meaning vs subordinate meaning vs unrelated meaning)

## Results

- Homonymy: no prime effect on N400. Subordinate target elicited more P600 than unrelated. Not discussed much later.

- Polysemy: both meanings had lower N400 than unrelated. Messy P600 pattern. (For the metonymic polysemy, there is a reduction of P600 for both related meanings relative to unrelated meanings. Metaphorical polysemy showed larger P600 for subordinate compared to dominant meanings, but not compared to unrelated meaning).
