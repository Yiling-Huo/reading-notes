- Purpose: investigate the aging effect on categorical perception of MC tones with varied F0 contours and duration.
- Method: younger and older native listeners. 2 Exps: tone identification and tone discrimination. Duration manipulated at 3 levels: 100, 200, 400ms. 
- Results: older listeners performed with shallower slope  in tone identification and smaller peakedness in discrimination. Comparable categorical tonal perception in young vs old adults.

## Intro

## Method

### Listeners

13 younger and 13 older adults (20-26yrs; 60-70yrs).

### Speech signals

synthesized based on isolated Mandarin vowel /a/ recorded by an adult female speaker. Original duration of /a/ was 556ms, and the nuclear 100-, 200-, and 400-ms segments were selected as the standard stimulus for F0 contour manipulation.

### Procedures

#### Tone identification

165 trials. The identification task required listeners to identify a given stimulus as T1 or T2 in Exp1 and T1 or T4 in Exp2. Upon hearing the stimulus, participants had 10s to respond via clicking the corresponding button. 

#### Tone discrimination

Same-different paradigm. 140 discrimination trials, 7 blocks. Four possible combinations: AA, AB, BA, BB. Participants were asked to decide whether the pair of stimuli was the same or different by clicking the corresponding button. 

## Results

### Exp 1 (T1/T2)

## Discussion

other topics omitted

### Signal duration and categorical discrimination

A significant interaction between age and duration, such that young listeners showed very good categorical discrimination in all durations, whereas older adults only showed good categorical discrimination in longer durations (200ms and 400ms). 

"The younger group had significantly higher scores in discriminating the between-category pairs than the within-category ones at all durations, whereas for the older group, the similar pattern appeared only at longer durations, namely, 200 and 400 ms. These results indicated that no significant duration effect was observed for the younger group; however, for the older listeners, the longer the stimuli duration, the greater peakedness of tone discrimination functions."

**For our purpose: could we say that young adults can discriminate between tones within 100ms (of the syllable nuclear)?**
