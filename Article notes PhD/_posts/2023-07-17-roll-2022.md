- Traditionally Swedish word accents have a low functional load: they do not have any practical relevant role in distinguishing words from each other. Not many minimal pairs. Other cues such as word class or morphology can help distinguish words, so word accent is not strictly needed. (More functional load of word accent in Norwegian)
- However word accent has existed since 600AD in Swedish

## Swedish word accents
- Two word melodies, accent 1 (L or LH when focused, the default tone) and accent 2 (HL or HLH when focused)

## The rise of lexical word accents
- Historical linguistic account for the lexical word accents
- Proto Norse - modern Central Swedish

## The processing perspective
- Accent can help suppress unnecessary lexical activation during word recognition

## The predictive function
- Word accents are good predictors of how words will continue during processing
- Word accents can have a quasi-distinctive status as cues to their associated upcoming suffixes.
- Accent 2 is also a cue to a possible upcoming secondary stress

- When word accents are combined with the wrong suffix, it takes a longer time to respond to the grammatical meaning conveyed by the suffix (Söderström et al., 2012; Roll et al., 2013, 2015; Roll, 2015; Novén, 2021)
- P600 evidence that unexpected suffix due to word accent (Roll et al., 2013, 2015; Roll, 2015; Novén, 2021)
- Roll et al 2010 observed P600 effect for incorrect combinations of word accent and suffix with acceptability judgment task, although incorrect combinations did not significantly affect acceptability. 
- Gosselke Berthelsen et al 2018 used press button at sentence boundary task, and also observed word accent P600

- Theoretically accent 1 is a better predictor than accent 2 because it eliminates more potential competitors
- P600 is larger for invalidly cued accent 2-inducing suffixes, indicating greater morphological reanalysis effects (Roll et al 2010 2013)

## Pre-activation negativity (PrAN) evidences

- PrAN has been seen to be greater the more predictively beneficial a speech sound is (Roll et al 2017) in both acceptability and meaning tasks
