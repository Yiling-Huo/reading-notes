## Intro

There is some support for tone violation eliciting N400 effect (Malins and Joanisee 2012, Ho et al 2019, Li et al 2008). 

## Exp 1: Single syllable visual - auditory ERP
	
Participant sees a single character on screen, then hear a single syllable with randomly assigned SOA (800-1000ms) while the character stays on screen. Participants judge whether auditory stimulus is consistent with visual presentation.

|  | hearing T3 | hearing T2 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Match condition | 使 shi3 | 时 shi2 |
| Related condition | 时shi3 | 使 shi2 |
| Unrelated condition | 是 shi3 | 是shi2 |
	
### Results

both related violation and unrelated violation elicited N400. But there was no difference between related and unrelated. Further, there was no difference in hearing T3 or T2.

## Exp 2: monosyllabic visual - disyllabic auditory ERP

Participants saw single character followed by a disyllabic auditory stimulus. They judged whether the first syllable of the auditory is consistent with the visual character. 

|  | hearing T3 | hearing T2 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Match condition | 使 shi3tiu4 | 时 shi2tiu4 |
| Related condition | 时shi3tiu4 | 使 shi2tiu4 |
| Unrelated condition | 是 shi3tiu4 | 是shi2tiu4 |

Note that in all of their conditions, there was no actual T3 sandhi in the stimuli (the second syllable is always non-T3). In their fillers they had T3 sandhi trials (T2*T3, but no T3T3). 
	
### Results

same as exp 1. both violations elicited N400 but there was no difference between the two types of violation.

## Discussion

Maybe when people expect a syllable they always expect things in the base form, and in the lexical access stage (N400 window), the brain does not distinguish what could be a possible alternative form of the syllable. (i.e. sees 使, always expect shi3 and does not know that shi2 could be a possible version, therefor hearing shi2 elicits the same N400 as hearing shi4).
