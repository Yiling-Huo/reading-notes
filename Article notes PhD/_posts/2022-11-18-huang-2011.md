## Summary

Predictive coding is a framework for understanding redundancy reduction and efficient coding in the nervous system, main evidence from vision. Note that we are not mainly talking about the cerebral cortex, but the structures that are more low-level processing.

## Introduction

Redundancy in vision because visual input tend to be very similar across space and time.

- Space: neighbouring pixels tend to belong to the same object so have same features (complexity, color, etc)
- Time: vision tend to be consistent over time, so the same pixel tend to stay the same over time. 

It's been suggested that early sensory processing is to reduce redundancy and recode the sensory input into an efficient form.

The predictive coding framework can explain center-surround response properties and biphasic temporal antagonism of cells in the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) (LGN located in thalamus, primary vision processing)

The predictive coding framework can also explain some behaviour of higher level vision processing (V1-V4) and auditory processing

## Predictive coding: model and two illustrative examples

### General framework

- The underlying assumption of predictive coding is that the visual system tries to learn an internal model of the external environment and used this model to actively predict incoming signals.
- A Bayesian model of optimizing posterior probability of the internal model parameters (represented by firing rates in a network of neurons) under the predictive coding assumption.
- The minimum description length (MDL) framework can be seen to be formally equivalent to Bayesian maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation.

### Predictive coding in space

- Neighboring pixel intensities in most natural images tend to be spatially correlated over short distances. 
- The intensity at a particular pixel can thus be predicted based on the intensities surrounding it. The intensity at a particular pixel can thus be predicted based on the intensities surrounding it. 
- (Bayesian model)
- By subtracting the linear prediction from the actual pixel intensity, the residual response decorrelates the original image, thereby reducing redundancy.

### Predictive coding in time

- Spatial predictive coding is based on intensities from all surrounding neighbors, whereas temporal predictive coding is causal and based only on the past history of intensities.
- More sophisticated models of predictive coding in time rely on learning dynamic spatiotemporal models of the inputs and perform some form of optimal statistical filtering such as Kalman filtering of inputs.

### Predictive coding in the nervous system

#### Predictive coding in the retina

- The underlying assumption is that the retina tries to build an efficient (e.g. MDL) representation of the visual scene.
- The weighting function also depends on the signal to noise ratio SNR of the input signal. When SNR is low, the intensity value at the center can no longer be estimated reliably from its nearest neighbors. Instead, better estimation can be achieved by recruiting larger groups of surrounding points in order to cancel out the statistically independent noise. 
- In the temporal domain, as SNR decreases, one expects more pixels from the past to be used in generating a prediction. 

Hosoya: adaptation to different visual scenes with varying correlational structures should lead to marked changes in predictive coding in retinal ganglion cells. Experiment: expose ganglion cells to two types of stimuli: uniform field with perfect positive correlation between all image points and checkerboard pattern with perfect negative correlation between two sets of image regions. Cells become less sensitive to checkerboard stimuli and became more sensitive to uniform stimuli. Evidence indicate that retinal ganglion cells rapidly adapt to become less sensitive to stimuli they have been exposed to; in the process, they become more responsive to other stimuli (novel stimuli), as expected from predictive coding theory. (This sounds very important. It sounds like visual adapts to task by both learning new pattern and un-learning old pattern, same as syntactic adaptation?)

#### Predictive coding in the LGN

- LGN performs predictive coding by temporally whitening (decorrelating) the signal from the retina. 
- Assume spatial and temporal decorrelations are accomplished separately: the retina is assumed to reduce most of the spatial correlations, whereas the LGN removes much of the temporal redundancy in the input image. The model is consistent with the findings that the temporal bandpass filtering done by the retina is essentially flat (little temporal decorrelation) and the spatial receptive fields of LGN cells are very similar to those of retina cells (little additional spatial processing at the LGN). 

#### Predictive coding in the visual cortex

#### Predictive coding in other areas

- Principle of predictive coding has also been applied to the auditory system, hippocampus, ventral midbrain, frontal cortex, and many other brain areas. 
- Striking similarity between the optimal weights learned from natural sounds and the impulse response function of cat auditory nerve fibers. 

### Recent developments in predictive coding

Spratling showed that predictive coding can be implemented using a particular form of biased competition in which neurons compete to receive inputs.
Friston have explored how neural dynamics can be understood in terms of prediction errors. 

## Conclusion

- There exists strong experimental evidence for predictive coding in the early visual system.
- Many cognitive phenomena such as binocular rivalry, mismatch negativity, and repetition suppression can be explained within the context of predictive coding.

- Taken together, these examples suggest that predictive coding may be a general computational strategy employed by the brain.
