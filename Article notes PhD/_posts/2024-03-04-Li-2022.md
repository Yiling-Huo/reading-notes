- Investigated the interaction between perception, motor and cognition.
- Tested whether speech rate-altered Mandarin lexical tone perception in quiet and noisy environments could be affected by the bodily cross-modal information. 
- Found that facial and gesture cues can help tone perception in speed and noise.

## Intro

Speech perception irl is generally cross-modal and noisy. Listeners normally integrate auditory and visual information to cope, such as acoustic cues, facial cues, and cospeech gestures. It remains unclear how these interact with tone perception. 

### Speech perception in the babble noise

Speech babble can be used for both informational and energetic masking. Generally, energetic masking manifests interferences in time and frequency at the auditory periphery due to competing sounds, and informational masking refers to the masking over and above energetic masking, depending on whether the speech signal is similar to the masking noise and whether listeners are familiar with speech and noise. 

In lexical tone perception, normal hearing (NH) suffered more from multitalker babbles than from the quiet context due to energetic and informational masking. Until now, the issue of how listeners tackle cognitive load in lexical tone recognition in the competing multitalker babble environment has still been understudied. 

### The influence of varying speech rates on speech perception

Studies usually compare slow, normal, and fast speech rate. Slow rate could facilitate auditory speech perception due to distinct acoustic features. Fast speech rate has been considered harmful, resulting in an increase in perceptual complexity and cognitive load. 

Speech rate also affects Mandarin Chinese tone perception. [Blicher et al. (1990)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0095-4470(19)30357-2) found a significant effect of variations in syllable duration on lexical tone perception and claimed that slow speech enhanced the distinctive auditory property, contributing to the improvement of the detectability of the lexical tone stimuli. 

### Characteristics of Mandarin lexical tone perception

One study showing a timing effect in Mandarin tone perception, suggesting that longer duration is linked to perceptual benefits ([Wang et al. 2017](https://doi.org/10.1044/2017_JSLHR-H-17-0061), [Huang et al. 2015](https://doi.org/10.1121/1.4923268)). Longer duration facilitated tone perception for listeners, particularly for old listeners.  

### Visual cues affecting lexical tone perception

## Method

Task: tone identification

## Results

(Only accuracy was reported???!!!)

In the quiet condition, main effect of speed: normal speech (m = 0.98, sd = 0.16)
