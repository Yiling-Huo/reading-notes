## Design

"We manipulated listenersâ€™ prior knowledge of speech content by presenting matching, mismatching, or neutral written text before a degraded (noise-vocoded) spoken word."

## Findings

"When speech conformed to prior knowledge, subjective perceptual clarity was enhanced."

"a feedback process: activity in the inferior frontal gyrus was modulated by prior knowledge before activity in lower-level sensory regions of the superior temporal gyrus."

"Although sensory detail and prior knowledge both enhanced speech clarity, they had an opposite influence on the evoked response in the superior temporal gyrus."
	
Prediction enhances clarity. More sensory detail also enhances clarity. But prediction's enhancement happens in IFG before sensory processing.
