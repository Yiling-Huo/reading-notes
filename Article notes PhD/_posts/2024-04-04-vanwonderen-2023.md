- large-sample ERP study does not support rational adaptation of prediction.

- rational adaptation hypothesis: predictions develop with expected utility (stronger prediction when frequently confirmed than disconfirmed.)

## Intro

- strong vs. weak views of prediction; specific vs. semantic-only prediction
- Kuperberg 2016 proposal that lexical prediction can be understood by considering its potential costs and benefits: correct predictions facilitate word recognition and increase efficiency. Incorrect predictions incur a processing cost compared to no prediction.

- rational adaptation hypothesis
    - lexical prediction is one example of an adaptive, probabilistic process based on rational Bayesian principles (statistical regularities in the environment to guide behavior).
    - rational adaptation in speech perception, syntactic processing, semantic processing, and pragmatics.
    - tested in block approach and trial approach

## Methods

- 204 participants
- two-sentence discourse
- expected vs. unexpected target
- matching vs. mismatching definite article
- 60 expected + 180 unexpected sentences vs. 180 expected + 60 unexpected sentences
- pre-nominal prediction effect may be absent or reduced when the presented materials contain mostly unpredictable items

(1) Ik lees thuis graag het nieuws op papier. Daarom lees ik thuis dus iedere ochtend **deCOM krantCOM**/*__hetNEUT dagbladNEUT__ tijdens het ontbijt.

At home I prefer reading the news on paper. Thatâ€™s why every morning at home I read theCOM newspaperCOM/*theNEUT daily newspaperNEUT at breakfast.

## Results

- strong pre-nominal prediction effect
- prediction effect was numerically larger in predictable group (but it was the unexpected article having larger responses, not the expected having smaller responses), but Bayes factor supports no evidence for the rational adaptation hypothesis.
