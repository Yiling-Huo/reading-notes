This study investigated whether comprehenders use their knowledge of wider discourse (situation model) to predict (specific) upcoming words. 

## Exp 1

RQ: Whether listeners can use their knowledge of wider discourse to predict specific upcoming words. 

### Conditions
- Gender-consistent
    (Dutch) The burglar had no trouble locating the secret family safe. Of course, it was situated behind a bigNEU but unobstrusive paintingNEU
- Gender-inconsistent
    â€¦bigCOM but unobstrusive bookcaseCOM.

### Predictions

If listeners predicted specific target noun, the gender-inconsistent adjective should elicit different ERP responses than gender-consistent adjectives.

### Results

Time locked at adjective inflection onset, gender-inconsistent elicited small but reliable positive deflection than gender-consistent. Reliable N400 effect at the unpredicted noun. 

## Exp 2

- Conditions: same as Exp 1 but no first sentence (discourse)
- Results: No reliable difference between gender-consistent and inconsistent adjectives, no reliable N400 at the nouns.

## Exp 3

- Conditions: the same as Exps 1 (but only a subset of stimuli is selected)
- Methods: Self-paced reading
- Results: Trend but no clear inconsistency effect at the adjective or the subsequent three words. When only analysing trials that contained a second inflected adjective at cw+3, there was a reliably slow down effect of gender-inconsistent adjectives at cw+3/second adjective. 
- Interpretation: Although reading time effect didn't emerge until the second adjective, results support that (a) people can use discourse-level information to anticipate specific lexical items and (b) people were sensitive to the mismatch of immediate syntactic constraints and syntactic properties of the predicted noun. 

## General discussion

- Results converge with Wicha et al. (2004) who manipulated gender-marked prenominal determiner in Spanish and showed prediction-inconsistent determiner elicited larger left positivity 500-700ms. (Although the effect seen in current study differs in latency and location from Wicha 2004, which may be explained by time-lock criteria and experiment design).
= Because effects are seen before the onset of the target noun, these effects strongly suggest that comprehenders used sentential/discourse context to predict specific upcoming lexical items. 
= Prediction of the specific lexical item in the second sentence may come from the situation model established from the discourse (because prior discourse may suggest the relevance of concepts, but it only makes sense to predict specific lexical items in the context of the current sentence (???))
= Potential candidates for the discourse-level prediction of specific lexical items can be: (1) probability; (2) the system continually makes graded prediction; (3) prediction-by-production.
