## Abstract

"Speech segmentation, breaking continuous streams of sound into units that can be recognized, is a necessary step in auditory language processing. To date, most studies of speech segmentation have been limited to behavioral measures that may not index online segmentation as it occurs when listening to natural speech. In the present study, we measured **event-related potentials (ERPs)** evoked by **word-initial and word-medial syllables** equated for loudness, length, and phonemic content. This comparison provided an online measure of natural speech segmentation. **Word-initial sounds elicited a larger early sensory component (N100)**. In addition, we measured the effects of semantic and syntactic information on speech segmentation by comparing ERPs to word-initial and word-medial syllables in sentences with **varying amounts of semantic and syntactic content**. The results indicated that **neither semantic nor syntactic information is necessary for the word-onset segmentation effect to be observed**. We also identified additional ERP components that index more general semantic and syntactic aspects of natural speech processing."

## Findings

**N1 is only associated with word boundary. N1 effect only shows when comparing word-initial and word-medial syllables. When comparing word vs. nonword, only N400 shows but not N1.**
