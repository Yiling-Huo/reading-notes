## Intro

- Cognitive control: the cognitive system's ability to configure itself for the performance of specific tasks through appropriate adjustments in perceptual selection, response biasing, and the online maintenance of contextual information. 
- Little is known about how the intervention of control processes is itself brought about. (how do we know when control is needed)

Questions:
- on what basis is control recruited?
- once the relevant control processes are engaged in guiding task performance, how is their influence modulated or optimized?
- what processes govern how and when control is withdrawn? (with practice on some initially difficult tasks, performance becomes increasingly automatic. As this happens the need for control diminishes.)

## The conflict monitoring hypothesis

- we argue that there exists a system that monitors for the occurrence of conflicts in information processing (conflict monitoring). 
- conflict monitoring serves to translate the occurrence of conflict into compensatory adjustments in control: the conflict monitoring system first evaluates current levels of conflict, then passes this information on to centers responsible for control, triggering them to adjust the strength of their influence on processing. 

- the detection of conflict may be among the functions of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC).
