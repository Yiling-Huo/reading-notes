## Abstract

- The McGurk effect when auditory speech is presented with discrepant visual info. 
- Previous study show visual info plays a role in MC tone perception. 
- Various tone combinations of congruent and in-congruent auditory-visual materials.
- T3 is the easiest to identify while T4 is the hardest (for the non-tonal speakers)
- Native listeners rely more on auditory input

## Intro

## Methods

### design

2x2 with congruency (congruent vs. incongruent) and speaker group (native vs.  non-tonal)

### participants

81 non-tonal speakers and 61 native MC speakers. 

### stimuli

- word list with 10 MC monosyllabic words (plausible meaning in all our tones e.g. ma)
- 12 incongruent combinations (A1V2, A1V3, A1V4, A2V1, A2V3, A2V4, A3V1, A3V2, A3V4, A4V1, A4V2, A4V3)
- 4 congruent combinations (A1V1, A2V2, A3V3, A4V4)

### procedure

- task: identify the tones they perceived from the videos ("to determine which tone the speaker used")
- press a key corresponding to the tone, 10s to respond, no feedback

## Results

### native speakers

No significant effect of congruency, ceiling effect in both congruent and incongruent conditions (M > 0.99). However there's a small but significant effect of tone, such that T4 was the easiest to identify, followed by T3, T1, then T2.
