- Comprehenders use predictive processing to varying degrees depending on task demands.
- frontal post-N400 effects:
    - frontal positivity for prediction violations compared to unpredictable words in weak constraining sentences. 
    - frontal negativity for expected endings in constraining vs. unconstraining sentences. 
- size of frontal positivity effect was unchanged by task
- task and sentence type interacted in frontal negativity.
- **impact of violating predictions is largely stable across varying levels of effort/attention directed toward prediction**, whereas other comprehension processes can be modulated by task demands. 

## Intro

- Prediction-based effects are not obligatory, different prediction effects across population and task demands. 
- Even when prediction effect is absent, there can be other comprehension effects. 

- participants read sentences first in passive comprehension block, then in active prediction block (instructions). 

### Multiple mechanisms underlying context effects
