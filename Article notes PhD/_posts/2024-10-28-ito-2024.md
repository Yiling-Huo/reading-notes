- Meta-analysis of 20 VWE paper show small but reliable phonological prediction effect

## Intro

- Prediction must be detailed and include phonological information to drive phonological learning (?)
- ERP evidences: Delong 2005, Martin 2013, but Nieuwland 2018, Laszlo Federmeier 2009, Ito 2016
- MEG evidence of early word form activation: Kim Lai 2012, Dikker 2009, but Nieuwland 2019
- Prediction at articulation level: Drake Corley 2015ab, picture naming paradigm (small effect of articulator movement, no effect on naming latency)
- VWE evidence: 
    - preview time: Kukona 2020 500ms pre-sentence, phonological competitor effect; Ito Husband 2017 longer preview, no competitor effect
    - target present vs. absent: could competitor effects when target present due to spread activation of predicting the target based on visual info?
    - type of visual presentation: kana vs. kanji, more phonological effects with kana than kanji Ito 2019; even smaller competitor effects when using objects Ito Sakai 2021
    - size of phonological overlap: Shen 2021 more competitor effects when more phonological overlap
    - task: more competitor effect in pronunciation judgement task than word judgment task Zhao 2023
    - individual differences: working memory: higher working memory span may be more likely to have competitor effects but overall no significant effect Angulo-Chavira 2023

## Meta analysis time course

### Preview effects

- "I computed the predictive phonological competitor effect by subtracting the fixation proportion (the proportion of trials in which the object/word was fixated) on the unrelated (control) object/word from that on the phonological competitor object/word for each 20 ms and each subject and used this for computing the effect size."
- onset of effect determined using bootstrap

### Other effects

- target absent/present, target cloze probability, picture/printed word, language.
- intercept-only model suggest significant phonological competitor effects

Q: why effect larger for picture vs. word? number of studies?

## Discussion

- phonological competitor effects emerged soon after the visual stimuli appeared but became weaker by the time the target word was heard. 
- competitor effects modulated by cloze probability, and marginally by target presence and visual stimuli type

- smaller effect of phonological prediction than phonological cohort effects in lexical decision
- phonological prediction might rarely occur in real life
- although context may be richer in real life
- phonological prediction effects too short lived to detect?
- possibility of null effects given small power of available experiments

- 400-500ms after visual display onset (Q: what about predictive cue onset)
- effect duration 600ms
- prediction effects not aligned with target onset in most studies, suggesting people do not predict when the target word is likely to occur (???but how could they)
- effect due to production vs. priming (I think priming makes more sense and aligns more with evidence)

# Conclusion

- small and short lived phonological competitor effect
- depends on cloze probability
- may not be a common occurrence
