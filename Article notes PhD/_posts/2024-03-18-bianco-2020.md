- Participants detected the emergence of regularly repeating patterns within rapid tone-pip sequences.
- A few patterns reoccurred every 3min.
- Reoccurring patterns were associated with a rapidly growing detection-time advantage over novel patterns.

## Intro

- The ability to identify essentially any sound source requires the capacity to hold consecutive events in memory so as to link past and incoming information into a coherent emerging representation.
- Observers can retain detailed sensory information implicitly, over long periods.
- We ask whether naive listeners can become sensitized to sparsely reoccurring tone sequences and investigate the conditions under which such memories are formed. 

- Sequences were novel and too rapid to allow for conscious tracking but on most trials participants were able to respond soon after the onset of the second cycle of regularity, implicating an efficient memory for the immediate sequence context. 

- The ideal-observer model proposes that listeners acquire an internal representation of the sound input by keeping track of multiple-order Markovian transition probabilities. This context is then used to evaluate the (un)expectedness of ensuing sounds by deriving a measure of surprisal. 
- The transition from a random to a regular pattern can therefore be detected as a salient drop in information content in the model output. 
- RT suggests that listeners indeed identify the emergence of regularity by detecting the associated drop in information content and that such tracking of instantaneous expectedness constitutes an automatic, inherent aspect of auditory sequence processing. 

- **Participants listened to RAN and RANREG sequences and were instructed to press a keyboard button as soon as possible when a transition to REG was detected**.
- A few different regular patterns reoccurred very sparsely (every -3min) across trials (RANREGr). 

- We hypothesized that if the stored representation of a pattern strengthens through repetition, the information content associated with a transition to a familiar regularity will dip earlier than that associated with a novel regular pattern. Behaviourally, this should be revealed as faster reaction times to reoccurring patterns.

## Results

- RT to STEP was subtracted from the RT to RANREG and RANREGr to estimate a lower bound measure of the time required to detect the emergence of regularity.

### EXP 1A

- three sessions: day 1, day1+24h, day1+7week
- faster RTs in RANREGr than in RANREG were observed in all participants by the end of the first session.

- Explicit memory for reoccurring regularities was examined at the end of each session by means of a familiarity task.
- Only regular sequences were presented (REGr and REG). 
- MCC scores did not correlate with the RT advantage.
