## Intro
1. Phonological prediction (in L1):
    a. Evidence from two types of ERP studies:
        i. The similar form design: "The student went to the library to borrow a… (book vs. hook vs. sofa)"
        ii. The pre-target mismatch design: "The day was breezy so the boy went out to fly a/an…(kite vs. airplane)"
    b. A time course problem:
        i. Assuming phonological prediction, ERP studies cannot tell us when phonological prediction occurs. 
        ii. Two accounts:
            1) Phonological prediction happens immediately after prediction of the word (e.g. 'kite' after 'breezy' and 'boy')
            2) Phonological prediction only happens immediately before the target (e.g. 'kite' after 'a')
        iii. What can VWE do?: Continuous recording of eye movement so can capture the time when phonological prediction occurs. 
2. Phonological prediction in L2:
    a. Less resource available for L2 comprehenders
        i. Evidence shows L2 comprehenders do predict (semantics and syntax)Target
        ii. Martin et al. (2013) showed that L2 speakers do not have the a/an N400 effect
        iii. It's possible that L2 comprehenders can do phonological prediction but only when the word is highly highly predictable
        iv. This study will use really high cloze probabilities
    b. Competition from L1
        i. Some evidence that show L2 speakers activate L1 phonology during L2 comprehension. 
        ii. But it remains unclear whether L1 phonology is pre-activated during L2 comprehension.

## Study design

- Visual world eye-tracking
- Highly constraining sentences
- Four conditions:
    - Target
    - English competitor
    - Japanese competitor
    - Unrelated

## Predictions

- If prediction, then more looks to target prior to target onset
- If phonological prediction, more looks to English competitor 
- If phonological prediction of L1 translation, more looks to Japanese competitor

## Participants

- L1 group: 24 native English speakers
- L2 group: 24 L1 Japanese L2 English speakers, proficient in English (7/10)

## Stimuli
- Auditory stimuli:
    - 16 items, 16 fillers
    - 2.6 syllables per second
    - Fillers 75% of the time mentioned a distractor in the visual display (50-50 of sentence mentioning something in the visual display throughout experiment)
    - Highly predictable target word mid-sentence: ‘‘The tourists expected rain when the sun went behind the cloud, but the weather got better later.”
    - Cloze probability: 97.5% (SD = 3.7, range = 91.7–100%) in L1 speakers and 88.6% (SD = 7.1, range = 81.8–100%) in L2 speakers

- Visual display: 
    - one critical object + three distractors
    - Four conditions: (condition manipulates the critical object)
        - Target
        - English competitor
        - Japanese competitor
        - Unrelated

Picture norming average 90%

## Procedure

- Picture familiarisation task
- Eye-tracking:
    - Task: listen to the sentence and judge whether sentence mentioned any of the objects in the visual display (no feedback)
    - Visual presentation 1000ms before onset of predictable words (mid sentence???)

## Results

- Picture familiarisation task: pictures are easy to associate with the labels
- Comprehension question: ceiling
- Eye-tracking data analysis:
    - Linear mixed-effects (for L1 and L2 separately)
        - 50ms bins
        - Non-AOI observations included in analyses
        - Arcsine-transformed fixation proportions on the critical objects as predicted by condition, for each time bin -1000-1000 after target onset.
        - Random intercepts by participant and by item
        - Conclusions are based on periods where a series of consecutive bins showed a significant difference
        - Significance: t>2
    - Growth curve analysis
        - Third-order (cubic) orthogonal polynomial.
        - Tested for effects of time, and interaction of condition by language group (no multiple comparisons)
        - Japanese competitor condition excluded from analysis because of non-significance in linear models
        - Log-odds transformed binomial fixation proportions (whether or not on critical object) by condition and language group and interactions.
        - By-participant and by-item analyses. Participant/item random effects on all time terms and participant/item-by-condition random effects on all time terms except cubic
        - Significance: t>2
- Eye-tracking results:
    - Linear mixed-effects:
        - ![growth](/img/articles-phd/ito-2018-2.png)
    - Growth-curve analysis:
        - More looks to target and English competitor overall
        - Significant condition (target vs unrelated) by language group interaction on the cubic term for the Target condition
        - Significant condition (English competitor vs unrelated) by language group interaction on the quadratic term for the English competitor condition. 
        - ![log](/img/articles-phd/ito-2018-3.png)
    - Relationship between L2 exposure and phonological competitor effects
        - Arcsine-transformed proportion of fixation to English competitor by years of exposure to English
        - Significant correlation (R=0.55)
        - ![correlation](/img/articles-phd/ito-2018-4.png)
    - Summary:
        - Both L1 and L2 speakers looked at the target prior to target onset
        - Native English listeners looked predictively at English competitors (-350--500ms) (phonological competitor prediction effect)
        - L2 listeners did not look at phonological competitors predictively, but looked at English competitors after target onset (phonological competitor priming effect)
        - Native listeners also looked at target more than L2 listeners
        - The extent to which L2 listeners looked at English competitors is associated with years of English exposure

## Discussion

- The timing of phonological prediction in L1
    - The phonological prediction effect found in this experiment is close in terms of onset with Rommers et al.'s shape prediction effect, but much shorter in duration (only 150ms).
    - The short duration of phonological prediction effect may be due to stronger semantic prediction which may include boarder info than phonological prediction. 
    - Shape prediction in Rommers et al may be easier with the help of the visual scene. 
    - Picture familiarisation task might have made participants more engaged in phonological processing during eye-tracking
    - Phonological prediction effect was 500ms prior to target onset, suggesting that phonological prediction does not only happen for the immediate next word (account 1 supported)
- No evidence for phonological prediction in L2
    - Consistent with Martin et al 2013. 
    - Prediction-by-production account: 
        - Prediction-with-implementation: prediction goes through the production order (e.g. semantics before phonology); full implementation requires resources, phonological prediction is thus less likely to occur when resource is limited. 
    - Cloze probability difference: cloze is higher for L1 than L2, but overall cloze is extremely high compared with other studies
    - Picture label difference: L1 picture label accuracy is higher than L2, but this is unlikely the cause of lack of effect because of picture familiarisation. Moreover there is a phonological competitor effect, just after target onset. 
- No evidence for L1 (pre-)activation during L2 comprehension
    - Possible that Japanese-English bilinguals did not activate Japanese because experiment was in English (but inconsistent with other studies)
    - Possible that Japanese phonological competitor effect is too weak to affect eye movement
    - Possible that picture familiarisation was in English rather than Japanese affected the results
    - Possible that lack of Japanese competitor effect is because of lack of orthographic overlap (kumo - kuma). 

## Conclusion
- Both L1 and L2 speakers predict
- L1 predicts phonology whereas L2 doesn't. 
- Compatible with limited phonological prediction
