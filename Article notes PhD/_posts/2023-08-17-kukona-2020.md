## Intro

- Key questions in prediction: do people predict form and what mechanisms support these predictions?
- Mixed results for form prediction
- Prediction mechanisms: prediction-by-production, prediction-by-association
- Prediction-by-association can also apply to phonology: form can also have spread activation

## Present study

- To replication form prediction effect in VWE
- To investigate predicition-by-association

## Experiment 1
### Method

- 30 native english speakers
- Visual array included a target, a chpnological competitor, and two unrelated. Pictures based on Ito 2018
- Task: click on the picture referred to in the sentence after auditory offset.
- 16 experimental trials and no practice or filler trials

### Results

### Discussion

- These results conceptually replicate prior visual world research demonstrating the preactivation of form during sentence process- ing
- Prediction effects are the storngest when the associated word (dentist) is playing
- Experiment 2 aimed to provide a more compelling test of this explanation: while prediction-by-association fundamen- tally links preactivation to lexical processes, form effects stem- ming from the spread of activation across both semantics and form have not been investigated in the visual world paradigm

## Experiment 2 
### Method

- 30 native speakers
- Heard words in isolation (either associated word dentist or target word mouth)
- No explicit task

### Results

### Dicsussion

- Exp 2 mirrored Exp1: phonological competitor fixated more than distractors
- Activation spreads across both semantics and form within the mental lexicon (dentist - mouth - mouse)

## General discussion

- The current results provide two novel insights: First, converg- ing with Ito et al. (2018), these results provide support for the preactivation of form during sentence processing; and second, these results provide new insight into (e.g., the breadth of) spread- ing activation within the mental lexicon, a foundation of prediction-by-association.
- supporting prediction-by-association
- as compre- henders process individual words like “dentist” (i.e., whether in a high cloze probability sentence or isolation), activation spreads to semantically related representations like mouth, which in turn spreads to phonologically related representations like mouse

- Question is whether there's anything else than prediction-by-association

- VWE has visual display and is different from ERP designs and form effect in VWE may be more robust
