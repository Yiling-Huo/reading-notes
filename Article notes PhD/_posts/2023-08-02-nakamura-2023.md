## Chapter 1 Introduction

- Argument role reversal as a test case of generation and measurement of lexical prediction. 
- Some measures of prediction see an effect with role reversal, some don’t.
- The simple model of lexical pre-activation

- The core feature of the pre-activation mechanism in the simple activation model is to map the contextual info and stored knowledge onto the pre-activation of lexical representations. Some frame this as memory retrieval. 

### Two inputs of prediction: context and prior knowledge

- Competitive dynamics: lexical candidates are activated in parallel. 
- Speeded cloze task support parallel activation via RT effects. 

#### linking hypothesis

The crucial assumption is that all the different measures take the same lexical pre-activation as their inputs, and output observable behavioural or neural measures.

Cloze tasks: does not involve direct presentation of continuations, no need to pre-determine one or a few lexical items to investigate for each context. 

Staub et at's Race model: the candidate item that reaches the threshold first and wins this race is produced. The cloze prebability is the probability that an item reaches the threshold first, and the RT is the time it takes on average to reach that threshold. 
Alternative view: sampling view: each particiapnt believes that x is xx% and y is yy% likely to follow the context, and randomly determine which word to produce during cloze task. Cloze probability = subjective probabilities.

## Chapter 2 The speeded cloze task and the Race model

- FT: finishing, the time needed by a candidate to reach threshold.
- The first aim of this study is to examine whether the slope of the correlation between the cloze probability and the cloze RT is the same in the human data Staub collected.
- people seem to produce slowly activated items more often than predicted by the Race model, I show that it instead results in an overestimation of the RT variability
- I propose that an additional assumption of lateral inhibition between the predicted candidates can explain such human behavior unexpected by the basic Race model

### Simulation1: RT probability correlation and RT variability

Human data has a much steepter slope compared to the simulations: there are many "slow winds" in human data unexpected by the model. 
Simulation 1: extending sigma (sd) while adding more contexts

However human RT sigma must be less than 500ms (for the high cloze items), so FT varability is not the only problem. 

### Simulation 2: lateral inhibition

- An additional lateral inhibition is required for the Race model
- A common assumption in lexical activation is that each lexical item inhibits others, which is not in the old Race model. 
- if there is lateral inhibition between competitors, low-cloze items would be more likely to be strongly inhibited by the competitors than high-cloze items would be. This would result in lengthened FTs and RTs especially for those items. If low-cloze items receive more penalty in their RTs through inhibition, the slope of the RT-cloze correlation would be steeper.

#### Strength vs. activation level

- Not possible in old race model
- In new model, strength is the mu parameter for each lexical candidate, which determines the average rate of pre-activation. Candidates with greater µ values can be understood as strong lexical candidates in the context, which tend to accumulate activation more quickly compared to those with smaller µ values. (strength = probability of activation?)

#### context constrains: availability vs dominance
    
Under the new race model, mean cloze RTs better represent availability (maximum strength) while the model cloze probabilities better represent the dominance (strength difference).
