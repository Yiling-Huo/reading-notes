## Intro
Free energy principle: any adaptive change in the brain will minimize free energy. 

## Free energy and self organization

- Free energy is an information theory quantity that bounds the evidence for a model of data
- Data are sensory inputs and the model is encoded by the brain.
- Free energy is greater than the negative log-evidence or surprise in sensory data. 
- Unlike surprise itself, free energy can be evaluated because it is a function of sensory data and brain states. Under simplifying assumptions, it is just the amount of prediction error. 

## The Bayesian brain

- Mathematically, the difference between free-energy and surprise is the divergence between a probabilistic representation (recognition density) encoded by the agent and the true conditional distribution of the causes of sensory input. 
- This representation enables the brain to reduce free energy by changing its representation which makes the recognition density an approximate conditional density. 
- The free energy principle subsumes the Bayesian brain hypothesis or the notion that the brain is an inference or helmholtz machine. 

## Beyond bayes to active inference

- To reduce surprise we have to change sensory input.
- According to the free energy principle, our actions should also minimize free energy (IFM??? That forward model is also responsible for action??)
- Action can reduce free energy ie prediction errors by changing sensory input, whereas perception reduces free energy by changing predictions. 
- In this view, perception is enslaved by action to provide veridical predictions that guides active sampling of the sensorium.
    1. agents resist a natural tendency to disorder by minimsing a free energy bound on surprise
    2. this entails acting on the environment to avoid surprises
    3. which rests on making Bayesian inferences about the world
