- generative model to process and produce events

## Event representation

#### core properties of an event

- composed of multiple different elements (linguistics, thematic roles)
- change in state in the world that bridges action and perception
- finite in duration (has an end state)
- dynamic in nature (unfolds in a passage of time)

#### sequences of events

- a visual real-world action event is composed of a sequence of shorter events that unfold over time (make tea: fill kettle, switch on kettle....)
- to link events together, we draw upon our basic knowledge of how human agents act upon their environment (to predict the next event)

#### event schemas

- schemas: longer-term semantic knowledge that extrapolates and generalized experience over many encounters, "structured event complexes"
- schemas may not be fixed, but probabilistic
- clusters of schema-relevant events must be available to assemble and disassemble dynamically. 

## The challenges of event comprehension

#### probabilistic prediction

- prediction offers speed and accuracy
- predictions are generated implicitly by an event model (high-level representation of the prior context)
- predictions generated by the event model are further constrained by the presence of schema-relevant knowledge 
- predictions are propagated down to lower levels of representation where they pre-activate upcoming information at these lower levels

#### event boundaries

- effective probabilistic prediction needs the system to be able to detect systematic changes in the statistical structure of the environment
- evidence for detecting this change comes from event boundaries in real-time [citation](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2014.09.018).

#### prediction error as an indicator of environmental change

- event segmentation theory: we track the magnitude of implicit prediction error produced by each incoming event
- if we encounter an event that is very dissimilar to the event that we implicitly predicted the resulting prediction error leads to update of the event model

#### open questions

- how do we build event models in the first place
- how to decide whether prediction error is big enough to build a new event model
- do we anticipate event boundaries

## A hierarchical generative framework

#### generative models: structures and principles

- observations from the environment is generated by underlying hidden (latent) causes
- hierarchical generative model
