- subject-verb agreement vs. reflexive anaphors in English
- comprehenders need to check that the subject of the current clause has the correct morphological features
- Exp 1: within-sugject. Agreement resolution displays clear intrusion effects in comprehension, but reflexives show no such intrusion effect from illicit antecedents.
- Exp 2: replicated no null intrusion effect of reflexives. 
- "Despite the fact that agreement and reflexive dependencies are subject to a similar morphological agreement constraint, in online processing comprehenders appear to implement this constraint in distinct ways for the two dependencies."

## Intro

- Language comprehension relies on working memory to construct relationships between words and phrases that allow understanding. 
- Long distance dependencies can help us understand the nature of these memory systems.
- Content-addressable memory system as a crucial component of the parser. (This allows direct access to representations whose content matches retrival cues, no need to engage in serial search of memory) (This means that the time course of memory access should be constant across different dependencies)
- In such an architecture, however, memory retrieval may be impeded if multiple representations match the retrieval cue. 

- a view that a single, direct-access retrieval mechanism is used for processing linguistic relations as diverse as subject-verb agreement, filler-gap processing, licensing of negative polarity items (NPIs), verb-phrase ellipsis, and referential processing ([Foraker & McElree, 2007](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jml.2006.07.004); [Lewis & Vasishth, 2005](https://doi.org/10.1207/s15516709cog0000_25); [Lewis et al., 2006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2006.08.007); [Martin & McElree, 2008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jml.2007.06.010), [2009](https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/a0016271); [McElree et al., 2003](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0749-596X(02)00515-6); [Vasishth et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1080/03640210802066865); [Wagers, Lau, & Phillips, 2009](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jml.2009.04.002)). 
- It's necessary to specify the retrieval cues used to access linguistic memory (the nature of the cues used and how they combine at retrieval) (see [Van Dyke & McElree, 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jml.2011.05.002)). Each dependency is associated with its own grammatical constraints that may restrict memory retrieval. So one questin is what's the relationship between the grammatical constraints associated with a given dependency and the cues that are used to guide memory retirevals associated with that dependency. 



## Exp 1

- within-subject comparison of subject-verb agreement and reflexive licensing.
- whether syntactically illicit, feature-matched noun phrases impact the formation of dependency at the point of retrieval of the local subject. 
- retrieval is triggered at the inflected verb for subject-verb agreement, and at at the reflexive anaphor for reflexive-antecedant dependencies. 
- question is whether the commonly observed intrusion profile for agreement also obtains for reflexives. 

### stimuli

- grammaticality: agreement is singular in the grammatical condition, plural in the ungrammatical condition.
