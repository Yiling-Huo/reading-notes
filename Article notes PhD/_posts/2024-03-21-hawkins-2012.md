- **mixing cost/blocking effect/context effect** refers to how lexical decisions differ depending on whether the conditions are presented in "pure" blocks (only easy or hard trials) or "mixed" blocks (mixing easy and hard trials) (easy = high frequency, hard = low frequency)
- These context effects (blocking effect) can be induced using conditions with identical difficulty, but different timing properties. 
- Explanations of context effects based on task difficulty or error monitoring alone might be insufficient
- a role for decision time. 

## Intro

- In lexical decision exps, there might be easy (high frequency) trials and hard (low frequency) trials. If an experiment includes both easy and difficult conditions, these can either be presented in separate blocks or mixed together. 
- Choices in a pure block of *easy* stimuli are faster but less accurate than in a mixed block. 
- Choices in a pure block of *hard* stimuli are slower but more accurate than in a mixed block. 

- This context/block effect has been observed in many speeded decision tasks, including sentence verification ([citation](https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/0096-1523.7.3.688)), picture naming and arithmetic ([citation](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0749-596X(03)00094-9)), and lexical decisions ([citation](https://doi.org/10.1016/0001-6918(95)00050-X)). 

- Time-accuracy tradeoff: in mixed condition participants elected to spend more time on easy trials and less time on hard trials perhaps to minimize the overall time spent in the experiment.
