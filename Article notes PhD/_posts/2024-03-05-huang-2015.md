- Just-noticeable differences (JNDs) of tone pitch contour change were examined for three groups of MC listeners: amusics with (tone agnosics) and without lexical tone difficulties (pure amusics), and matched controls.
- Tone agnosics showed larger JNDs than normal controls, but pure amusics performed comparably with the controls. 

## Intro

## Methods

### listeners

12 pure amusics, 6 tone agnosics, 10 matched controls

### stimuli

Isolated vowel /a/ in T1 was first recorded. F0 contour is then manipulated to have three standard stimuli: T1 (250-250Hz), boundary (220-250Hz), and T2 (180-250Hz). **Duration of all stimuli was manipulated at 100 and 200ms**.

### procedure

Three tones played with 400ms intervals. First tone is standard, second and third are one standard and one with F0 change at random. Participants' task was to indicate *which* tone is different from the first standard tone.

In each block, the onset F0 change from the standard stimulus first started at 20Hz, then was adjusted in 5-Hz steps for the first three reversals and in 1-Hz steps thereafter. The JND for each condition was taken as the average threshold based on two 60-trial blocks. 

## Results

### JNDs of pitch contours

- JNDs of T1: Tone agnosics has significantly larget JNDs than the controls and the pure amusics, the latter two groups did not differ. **No main effect of duration or interaction between duration and group**.
- JNDs of boundary tone: for the shorter duration, the controls had smaller JNDs than both the pure amusics and tone agnosics. For the longer duration, the JNDs for the tone agnosics were larger than the controls, no difference between tone agnosics and pure amusics or between pure amusics and controls. 
- JNDs of T2: tone agnosics performed worse than the other groups. **No main effect of duration or interaction between duration and group**

## Discussion

- "The tone agnosics (those amusics with lexical tone deficits) showed markedly larger JNDs for pitch contour discrimination than both the pure amusics (those amusics without lexical tone deficits) and controls, regardless of stimulus duration."
- "The pure amusics differed from the controls in only one condition, i.e., they had significantly larger JNDs than the controls for the boundary tone discrimination at the 100 ms duration."
- "these results suggested that only those tone agnosics who had behavioral lexical tone difficulties were psychophysically impaired in discriminating tone pitch contours, whereas the pure amusics who did not have behavioral tone deficits were almost as sensitive to pitch contour changes as the controls"

- JNDs for both the pure amusics and tone agnosics were sensitive to duration changes, especially for the boundary tone condition. 


**For our purpose: Again typical native listeners can do very well recognition within 100ms.**
