<p>This is a review that integrated theoretical linguistics, neuroscience of language, and evolutionary evidence in establishing that the arcuate fascicle is vital and human unique in labeling of word combinations. In doing so they also reviewed the locus and function of the language circuit in the brain. A very Max Planck article thatâ€™s nicely written. (This paper can also work as an index of brain anatomy of language, with roles of cortices and pathways concisely explained :), together with the ontogeny one.)</p>

<p>The authors first argued a little against the merge-only view of syntax saying that labeling (assigning heads, an + apple = DP{an apple} in stead of an + apple = {an apple} with labels assigned later at interfaces) is crucial to the computation of syntax. They argued that merge-only seems not able to explain hierarchical structure of language.</p>

<p>The authors then moved on to talk about the brain language circuit, with an emphasize on the white matter connections. They used empirical data as examples to show the role of BA44 in hierarchical syntax, frontal operculum in linear grammar, BA45 in combination process, as well as two dorsal pathways, the superior longitudinal fascicle connecting the STG/MTG with premotor cortex (responsible for auditory motor integration), and the arcuate fascicle connecting BA44 with posterior STG/MTG (syntactic complex structure processing). And two ventral pathways, the extreme fiber capsule system, including the inferior frontal-occipital fascicle (IFOF) connecting BA45/47 with the temporal cortex, the uncinate fascicle connecting ventral prefrontal cortex with ATL (these are said to be evolutionarily older).</p>

<p>The article then cited various empirical studies and reasoned that, in a word, the arcuate fascicle (together with the larger and more lateralized BA44) is crucial to the evolution of human language, enabling asymmetrical hierarchical structure building. They also encouraged future studies to look at the precise role of the arcuate fascicle in hierarchical structure building.</p>
