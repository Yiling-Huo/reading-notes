<p>A chapter of the Oxford handbook of language and social psychology, about potential usage of ERPs (N400 and P600) in the study of active communication.</p>

<p>The chapter introduced the dialogue immersion paradigm, where the participant is given a script of conversation, and is made believe to talk to an actual intellector, while the 'intellector' is pre-recorded (allowing for ERP time lock). (I guess they give the scripte to the subject and tell them they are supposed to do a little act??) The authors argued that this is a way to introduce some 'sense of involvement', to approach real life active conversation, while having some control over the stimuli and the data. However, the experiment using the dialogue immersion paradigm was never really published? I only found a manuscript of an undergrad thesis on researchgate. </p>
