<p>Ok this sounds like excuses (maybe it is(). Apparently I'm not writing the notes as regularly as the last few months. One reason is that since I'm feeling healthier, I started to work on my project again. So when I was dedicating myself to data analysis (and learning data analysis, unfortunately(), sometimes I couldn't bring myself to read (bad habit, though!). Another reason is that I'm not writing notes to every article that I read, now that I'm trying to focus on specific topics and go deeper, sometimes there just seems to be very little to write about the article of the day. I certainly hope that this little blog goes on! So this is also a reminder to self that I should post more often. I've just printed more articles out (I used to be a full-time e-reader, but recently I feel that my eye sights have gone considerably worse, so sorry environment but I need to switch to less eye-destroying habits), and hopefully I'll find many things to write about them.</p>
