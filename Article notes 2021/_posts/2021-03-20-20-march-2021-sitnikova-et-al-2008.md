<p>An N400-P600 study that looked at real world events. Silent movies containing a context scene and a target scene was used (taking a chopping board and a loaf of bread - cut bread with bread knife (congruous); cut bread with electric iron (incongruous); iron shirt (unrelated)).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There was a P600 like effect with incongruous vs. congruous, and an anterior N400 like effect with unrelated vs. congruous. Whatâ€™s the most interesting to me is that the two effects were seemingly dissociable in this study, with incongruous - congruous showing little N400 effects and so on.</p>

<p>The authors discussed their findings under the semantic integration account of the N400, but maybe the newer retrieval account could have allowed them a more simple discussion.</p>
