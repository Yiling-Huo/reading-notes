<p>This is an unpublished work I bumped into while surfing the internet. A simultaneous MEG and EEG study on localization of the N400 and the P600.</p>

<p>Classical N400 and P600 inducing experiment designs were used, with some materials directly taken from Kutas &amp; Hillyard 1980 and Osterhout &amp; Holcomb 1992, it seems. Participants looked at visually presented words one at a time on ISI 300ms and made grammatical judgments at the end of each sentence. </p>

<p>I'm unfamiliar with MEG so I couldn't tell whether they did good data analysis. From what I understood, they correlated MEG source difference waves with ERP difference waves using mixed effects models. Their results, bery briefly, indicate that the N400 ERP is correlated with sources from the posterior portion of the left temporal region, while the P600 ERP is correlated with sources from the anterior remporal region. However, although they found the MEG N400 and the N400 ERP were in the same direction (more activity with more N400), they found the MEG P600 and the P600 ERP in opposite direction (more activity when less P600 i.e. in the control condition). They mentioned that the MEG community has been talking about an insensitivity of MEG to the P600 (null results), and could indicate that the P600 has subcortical source. They discussed the opposite directioness of MEG data and ERP data on the P600, and finally reached a hypothesis that the P600 might partly reflect normal structure building rather than reanalysis. (←something about this confuses me, yes of course there are regular structure building in sentence comprehension, but can we say that the P600 *reflects* regular structure building? Does this wording mean regular structure building is *contributing* to the P600? That regular structure building increases the amplitude of P600? It seems very doubtful that this is true. But it sure seem possible to me that the 'ERP component for regular structure building' overlaps with 'the P600', but the former should be masking the later according to my intuition. I'm not sure what the authors of this paper is trying to say at the end, I think the most useful piece of information I got from this paper is that the P600 may be largely subcortical.)</p>
