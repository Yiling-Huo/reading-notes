<p>This article introduces the Bayesian learning model. I'm not particularly familiar with developmental cognitive science, but this article surprisingly gave me some intuitive examples of things I didn't understand about Bayesian stats, especially about the basic concepts, priors and what they represent. </p>

<p>I've been doing a few things recently. First is learning stats (and how to talk about math in English in general). My project with my supervisor is also progressing, and I'm starting to do some writing. I thought I would be pretty bad at it since I haven't been writing for a long time, but thanks to all the reading I've been doing it's actually reasonably smooth. I'm also trying to do some part time job to help myself financially. I didn't get the scholarship (again), but "luckily" my tuitions can be considered paid for (sigh). Rumors are that by September schools will be open, so if I can't choose the remote option I have to figure out something to pay for my living costs.</p>
