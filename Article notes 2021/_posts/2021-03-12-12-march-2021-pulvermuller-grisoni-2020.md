<p>A very interesting brief introduction? review? of the novel prediction potential (PP), a slow negative-going potential shift preceding predictable (predicted?) stimuli.</p>

<p>The authors briefly reviewed the N400 and argued that the N400 shouldn't be an ideal index of prediction (which is supposed to happen before the onset of the critical word). Instead, citing recent experimental studies, they proposed that there is a negative-going potential shift that can be observed starting from several hundred ms before the critical word onset. The studies they cited used a range of stimuli types (spoken/written words, words-action sounds, etc.). I noticed that these studies generally had a longer gap between the previous word and the target word (for example 1s), presumably in order to separate prediction elicited activities and processing of the target word. The authors further argued against the hypothesis that the prediction potential is the result of attention or arousal, stating that the PP is observable when subjects are instructed to move their attention away from stimuli.</p>

<p>My question to this article is that, it seems that so far the prediction potential can only be observed in the "context constraining" condition. In the classic N400 literature there seems to be a distinction between context constraint and cloze probability, such that both high constraint and low constraint sentences can have low cloze probability (but plausible) endings, and the N400 only follows the cloze probability but not contextual constraint. Obviously, this contrast cannot be tested with the prediction potential paradigm (because the participant has no way of knowing the target word!), but I wonder whether this contrast means anything concerning the relation of this newfound potential and the N400. Maybe it would be interesting to have a study that looks at both potentials at the same time while trying to make the context vs. cloze distinction.</p>
