Similarities among the processing schemes evident in sensory systems, which suggest similar solutions to basic problems in perception.

## The auditory System

### Sound stimuli

The auditory system transforms mechanical energy produced by the movement of air molecules into neural signals that ultimately give rise to the perceptual qualities of the sounds. 

- local pressure changes that form a subset of the pressure changes normally occurring in the auditory environment
- variations in local pressure must fall within defined ranges of frequency and absolute pressure to activate the receptor cells of the inner ear. 

- Many of the pressure changes that trigger human hearing are caused by the ongoing movements of a *resonating body*, which provide stimuli that persist. 
- depending on the frequency components of the resonance, stimuli can generate the perception of a tone (periodic), or noise (aperiodic). 
- importance of periodic sound stimuli in vocal communication (although rare in nature). 

- When determined by Fourier analysis, the sound spectrum of a vibrating object shows a series of power peaks at predictable frequencies. 
- The most energetic component in the spectrum is called **fundamental frequency**. 

Different species are sensitive to different ranges and types of sound stimuli. A child or young adult can hear stimuli with frequencies from about 20Hz up to 20,000Hz or higher. Some species of bats are sensitive to frequencies as high as 200,000Hz. 

## The peripheral auditory system

The first stage of the transformation of local pressure changes into neural signals consists of pre-neural effects produced by the external ear and the middle ear. These structures collect sound energy and amplify local pressure so that the stimuli of particular importance (e.g. speech) are transmitted with greater efficiency. 

Concha and pinna collect and focus sound energy, while the resonance of the ear canal enhances the intensity of ecologically important sound stimuli. The three bones of the middle ear link the resulting deflections of the tympanic membrane to the inner ear, enhancing the stimulus energy transmitted to the oval window. The oval window is the entry to the cochlea, where the neural receptors of the inner ear are. The major features of the cochlea are the basilar membrane and its embedded receptor cells (hair cells). 

The movement of the oval window is transmitted to the fluid in the inner ear, which moves protrusions on the tips of the hair cells called stereocilia. The movement of the stereocilia depolarizes the membranes of the hair cells, leading to the release of transmitter molecules from the basal portion of the cells, which elicits synaptic potentials (and form potential action potentials resulting in auditory). Action potentials in auditory nerve fibers convey information about the frequency, amplitude, and phase of sound stimuli to the auditory processing regions of the brain, eventually leading to auditory perception.

Sound stimuli that activate a wide region of the membrane, are effectively decomposed into simpler tonal components by the inner ear. The basilar membrane is tonotopically organized, with stiffer portion reacting to higher frequencies and the apex reacting to lower. 

The first stage of central auditory processing in the brain occurs in the cochlear nucleus in the **rostral medulla** of the brainstem (the initial target of the auditory nerve axons). From there, peripheral auditory information diverges into a number of parallel pathways that project to one of several targets. 

Axons from the neurons of the cochlear nucleus project to the **inferior colliculus** in the midbrain, a major integrative center and the first place where auditory information interacts with the motor system to initiate auditory-guided behavior (e.g. turning heads). 

The **superiror olivary complex** is the first place that information from the two ears interacts. Cochlear nucleus neurons send projections to the nucleus of the **lateral lemniscus** in the midbrain as well, whose neurons process temporal aspects of sound stimuli that are critical to the localization of sound sources. 

Information processed in these stations in the brainstem is sent to the thalamus, where the relevant targt is the **medial geniculate nucleus**, a key station on the way to the cortex. From the thalamus, information is sent to the **primary auditory cortex** (A1). This series of stations defines the **primary auditory pathway**.
