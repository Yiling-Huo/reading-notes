## Brain Perturbations That Elucidate Cognitive Functions

### Pertubations imposed by stoke, trauma, or disease

If damage to a brain area or system disrupts a cognitive function, it is likely that the damaged region is involved in some critical way in the performance of that function. 

A major limitation of clinical-pathological correlations in humans is that brain damage is the result of many factors that are not under the control of the experimenter. E.g., although stroke-induced lesions can be relatively focal, they follow vascular-supply boundaries rather than being restricted to functional brain regions, thus a single lesion can have diverse effects on cognitive functions. Moreover, the distribution of brain regions supporting cognitive functions varies among individuals. This variability can be addressed to some degree by combining info about the locus of damage across a group of patients. 

Another way to study the relationship between brain damage and resulting deficits in cognitive functions is by making restricted electrolytic or surgical lesions in experimental animals, including non-human primates. This allows the researcher to control the location and extent of brain damage, limiting it to specific functional areas. However it's difficult to train and assess the animals carrying out cognitive tasks. There are also ethical concerns. 

Problems of lesion studies interpretation: the brain is highly interconnected. If one area is lesioned, other areas of the brain innvervated by the damaged area may cease to function normally from the loss of input (diaschisis). Damage to a cortical area can also damage nearby fiber tracts, disrupting the function of more distant areas. 

Modern neuroimaging methods allows brain lesions to be localised with considerable precision in living patients. Clinical-pathological correlation studies stay continuously relevant. 

### Pharmacological pertubations

Signalling between neurons involves the release of and response to neurotransmitter molecules at synapses. Many drugs interfere with or augment these processes and can change cognitive functions, e.g. caffeine, cocaine, antidepressants. 

Two main forms of pharmacological studies. The first approach is to examine the influence of chronic drug use or abuse on cognitive processes, e.g. the set of cognitive impairments in cocaine addicts, including changes in reward evaluation. Impaired reward evaluation in turn affects the ability to make self-protective decisions and to formulate and pursue successful life strategies. Cocaine specifically activates dopamine receptors, altering the physiology of the dopamine system, which is known to play a major role in reward evaluation. 

Chronic use leads to drug tolerance, which results in further negative consequences. This sort of pharmacological adaptation is familiar to habitual coffee drinkers, who need more caffeine to achieve the same stimulatory effect than do people who drink coffee only occasionally. 

More controlled pharmacological perturbation can be carried out in experimental settings in which a drug is administered acutely and its effects are monitored. E.g. the effect of nicotine on cognitive functions. Nicotine affects neurotransmission mediated by acetylcholine, interacting with cognitive processes that include mood, attention, memory, appetite, and neurological processes that can lead to addiction. Nicotine molecule binds to certain acetylcholine receptors and activates them just as the neurotransmitter acetylcholine itself does. Pharmacological manipulation can lead to inferences about the contribution of the relevant neurotransmitter system to the cognitive processes they affect. 

> Drugs like nicotine that bind to and activate receptors in a manner similar to a neurotransmitter are called **agonists**. Drugs that bind to and block receptors are called **antagonists**. 

A disadvantage of administering drugs systemically (injection into the bloodstream) for studying cognitive processes is the relative lack of specificity of their effects. Much of the brain is exposed to the drug and sorting out the effects on different brain systems can be difficult. 

A more specific intervention is to inject substances directly into specific brain areas of an experimental animal. This approach usually involves surgically implanting a cannula or other drug delivery system that can administer defined amounts of the experimental agent locally and in a highly controlled manner. 

### Perturbation by intracranial brain stimulation

Another way of perturbing brain function is direct electrical stimulation of a specific brain region, used by Charles Sherrington and David Ferrier in late 19th century. Electrodes are placed onto or into the brain of an experimental animal or human patient during a neurosurgical procedure. Electrodes can be placed transiently (just during surgery) or chronically for extended studies of the brain's electrical activity and responses to electrical stimulation. 

In animals, chronically implanted electrodes allow to assess the function of individual neurons or groups of neurons as the animal carries out a cognitive task it has been trained to perform. By altering the strength of the stimulus applied, the effects on the local neuronal population can be varied to provide additional information. E.g. moderate levels of stimulation can activate neurons and trigger behavior that suggests what a given population normally does. Strong stimulation tends to disrupt normal function, and can indicate how the loss of that neuronal population affects a particular cognitive process. The latter way can effectively create a transient and reversible lesion. 

### Perturbation by extracranial brain stimulation

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a far less invasive approach that can disrupt cognitive processing in normal subjects. A strong but transient and rapidly changing magnetic field is generated over a region of the scalp by passing an intense electrical current through a set of coils. The magnetic field induces an electrical field in the underlying brain tissue, resulting in an extraneous flow of current that interacts with local neural processing. This is typically disruptive, creating a reversible brain lesion limited to the underlying area. It can also be facilitative with weaker stimulation. 

Repetitive TMA (rTMS) applies a series of TMS pulses (e.g. one per second) over several minutes. Influence on a cognitive function of interest can then be examined by behavioral tests during and after the TMS application. Depending on the strength of stimulation, TMS can either impair or improve performance on tasks involving the stimulated area. 

Another approach is to deliver a single TMS pulse to a brain area at specific times during the course of a task trial and then study its influence on task performance on that trial. This approach provides greater temporal resolution.

Drawbacks to TMS. First, EMS tends to affect a relatively large area, limiting anatomical resolution. Second, only superficial brain regions can be effectively affected. Third, the technique can result in concurrent stimulation of scalp and head muscles, resulting in unconformable and even painful twitching. Finally, the stimulation entails some risk (triggering seizure). 

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is another approach for performing extracarnial brain stimulation, first developed in the 19th century. In tDCS, a constant low-amplitude electrical current is applied directly to the scalp. One electrode is placed over the area of interest to stimulate, and another is placed elsewhere to complete the circuit. There are two main types of stimulation: *anodal* (positive) is thought to increase the cortical excitability of the area; *cathodal* stimulation is to decrease the excitability. Like rTMS, tDCS appears to have effects that last for a period of time (many minutes) after stimulation. The main disadvantages of tDCS include spatial coarseness and a limited understanding of its mechanisms. 

### Optogenetics

Optogenetics is a recently developed technique for selectively stimulating neural circuits far more specifically. It combines genetics with the use of laser light to activate specific neural circuits or neuronal cell types in a variety of experimental settings, including a freely moving and behaving animal. It has both high neuronal selectivity and high temporal resolution. 

The excitability of neuronal membranes is controlled by ion channels that can be induced to open or close to let ions flow into or out of the cell. Normally, such ion channels respond to voltage changes across the cell membrane induced by the binding of neurotransmitters from other neurons. The basic principle of the optogenetics method involves incorporating ion channels that open or close in response to light of a certain wavelength into the neurons of interest. This provides a means of turning them on and off with light. Depending on the type of ion channels incorporated, the neurons can be either excited or inhibited with the light stimulation. 

Typically, genetic material that codes for the manufacture of photoreactive ion channels is extracted from light-sensitive algae and inserted into a virus. The virus can then be injected into a particular brain area of interest. The carrier virus infects targeted neurons near the site of injection, the inserted genetic material then leads to the production of these light-sensitive ion channels and their incorporation into the membranes of the infected neurons. 

This approach has been used to modulate the walking pattern of mice, to alter the escape response of fruit flies, and to reduce disordered movements in mice with motor signs similar to those found in Parkinson's disease. 

## Measuring Neural Activity during Cognitive Processing

> **Introduction to structural brain imaging techniques**
>
> The first technological breakthrough was computerized tomography (CT). CT uses a X-ray tube that is rotated around the patient's head. Compared with traditional X-ray images, CT gathers intensity information from multiple angles. Algorithms can then construct 3D image information for th full volume of the head, in addition to slices or tomograms. 
>
> Today, CT is largely replaced by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in research. Magnetic: protons in hydrogen atoms of the brain become aligned with the strong magenetic field of the scanner. Perturbation of this alignment can be measured and analysed to construct an image. Resonance: the ability of a system to absorb energy delivered at a particular frequency. Protons in the magnetic field will absorb energy when the energy is delivered at a resonant frequency. During excitation, the MRI scanner emits energy in the form of radio waves. After a few milliseconds, the protons begin to release the energy they absorbed. This released energy is the MR signal, which is measured by electromagnetic detectors. Imaging: coils in the scanner can cause the local magnetic field to differ in strength along specific directions. Varying these magnetic-field gradients, the MR signal is caused to vary correspondingly and systematically along the three axes. Computer can use this to create images of gray matter, white matter, the fluid in the ventricles, and other neural tissues. MRI is noninvasive, has extremely high spatial resolution, and can be sensitive to many different aspects of brain structure (e.g. grey/white matter, ventricles, water diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for fiber tracts). 

### Direct electrophysiological recording from neurons

This is the most common method used in experimental animals. The most popular modern use is single-neuron electrical recording, which entails measuring the action potentials produced by individual neurons either extracellularly or intracelllularly. 

Extracellular recording is done with tine tungsten or steel electrodes that are inserted into the extracellular space in the cerebral cortex or deeper brain structures. The electrode can measure one or more neurons near the tip. 

In intracellular recording, a single neuron must be penetrated by the electrode tip, which then records the electrical activity from within the cell as action potentials and post-synaptic potentials are generated. 

Recently, most such experiments have focused on studies in awake, behaving animals performing specific tasks, typically after extended periods of training. Typically an electrode recording apparatus is attached to the skull over a surgically exposed brain area of interest. The electrode can be moved to different positions above the brain area of interest and also can be advanced a controlled distance into the brain tissue, allowing recording from different parts and depths of the brain region below. 

There are two especially useful approaches to single-unit data acquisition. Peristimulus time histogram (PSTH) depicts the neuronal firing pattern across time in response to the stimulus. Such an approach averages out random background firing when applied over enough trials, giving a much clearer picture of the average response specifically related to the stimulus processing with respect to the task being performed. 

In tuning curves, a stimulus is varied along a particular dimension (e.g. the orientation of a line, the frequency of a tone), and the strength of the response is plotted (usually in terms of spikes per second) as a function of the stimulus parameter being varied. The resulting curve defines the selective sensitivity of the cell to some values of that stimulus parameter relative to others. 

Recently, researchers have started to employ multielectrode recording arrays to evaluate the concurrent responsiveness of sets of neurons in a given area or in related brain regions, instead of single electrodes. 

Some of the basic functions such as those underlying sensory processing are generally amenable to study in nonprimate experimental animals. More complex functions such as attention, decision making, and symbolic representation are more typically undertaken in monkeys. Some cognitive functions such as language or abstract reasoning can be only studied in humans. There is great interest in taking advantage of circumstances in which intracranial electrophysiological recording can be performed in humans e.g. during presurgical cortical mapping procedures. 

### Electroencephalography (EEG)

EEG recordings measure electrical brain waves that can be detected at the scalp. EEG recording is fully noninvasive. It uses a set of surface electrodes which typically are embedded in an elastic cap fitted over the scalp. The voltages at each electrode along with that of a reference electrode placed elsewhere often the mastoid bone behind the ear are fed into differential amplifiers. The amplified signals are then digitized and recorded for subsequent analysis. Frequency of the EEG voltage range from a fraction of 1 hertz to 100 hertz or more. 

EEG signal derives from the summed dendritic field potentials of groups of neurons, rather than action potential. E.g. when there is excitatory synaptic input to the dendrites near the cell body, the voltage across the membrane of the underlying neuronal dendritic trees is depolarized by the synaptic activity. The resulting separation of charge created along the length of the dendrites causes intracellular current flow along the inside of the dendrite as well as conduction of the return current through the tissue volume outside the dendrite. The scalp electrodes pick up the fluctuating voltages associated with these dynamically changing return currents.

Because the nonspike electrical fluctuations that occur in and around the dendritic trees of the large cortical pyramidal cells can also provide important insight into neural processing, more animal researchers recording intracranially are now also studying these slower-frequency dendritic field fluctuations, aka local field potentials (LFPs) when measured intracranially. These field potential fluctuations reflect variations in the polarization of the dendrites due to modulation by axonal input coming from other brain regions. Thus they reflect more of the integrative processing of these large cortical neurons rather than the output firing of the cell to other regions that is reflected in spike recordings. 

Ongoing EEG signals measured over time are widely used clinically to assess brain function. These signals are typically analysed in terms of the power in various frequency bands, including delta (<4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (12-25 Hz), gamma (25-70 Hz) and high gamma (70-150 Hz). The relative power in these bands is very useful for assessing the overall state of the brain such as arousal level and sleep stages, as well as for detecting and monitoring the abnormal activity associated with epilepsy. 

### Event-related potentials (ERPs)

ERPs in the most common signals to extract from the ongoing EEG using a time-locked averaging approach, relating scalp electrical activity to cognitive function. ERPs provide high temporal resolution of the neural processing underlying various cognitive functions. However, it is necessary to average multiple trials to extract ERP signals from the background noise. The average ERP trace generally comprises a series of negative and positive peaks that are typically named according to their electrical polarity and their latency or their order in the sequence. 

Information can also be gained from the spatial distribution of the scalp recordings as a way to gain some understanding of the likely sources of the activity. If many electrodes are used, analysis algorithms can be used to estimate the location of the neural generators producing scalp-recorded ERPs. For simple distributions such as ERP waves that reflect relatively early sensory processing, this approach can work reasonably well. However a fundamental problem is the inverse problem: a given distribution of electrical activity recorded at the scalp could have been produced by any one of a number of different sets of generators inside the head. 

Recently there has been increasing interest in event-related averaging approaches applied to oscillatory activity in the EEG signal. This approach differs in several ways from earlier EEG analyses that focused on changes over a relatively extended period of time in the power of different frequency bands. The newer approach extracts the average changes in amplitude (power) or phase coherence (how synchronized the waves are over different cortical regions) in specific frequency bands following (or preceding) a specific type of cognitive event. These time-locked changes in oscillatory activity are associated with cognitive functions including binding of perceptual features, attentional modulation, and cognitive control. 

### Magnetoencephalography (MEG)

MEG is the magnetic conterpart of EEG. It can also be used to extract time-locked responses, called event-related magnetic-field responses (ERFs). The key difference between EEG and MEG is that MEG measures the magnetic fields produced by depolarization in the dendritic trees rather than the associated voltage fluctuations. Knowing the measured field distribution makes it possible to estimate the location and orientation of the underlying source, but the same general limitations imposed by the inverse problem for EEG apply to MEG as well. 

MEG is sensitive to neuronal activity in the sulci and is relatively insensitive to activity in gyri. This sensitivity is due to the orientation of the electrical currents that generate the magnetic fields. 

MEG signals are easier to localize than EEG signals. EEG currents suffer some distortion as they are conducted through the variable resistances of the skull and other tissues. Recordings by MEG and EEG methods together can offer a more complete and effective way to estimate sources and study mechanisms than does either method alone. 

### Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging

The most popular techniques for assessing brain activity related to cognitive functions are those that measure blood flow to visualize active areas of the brain. This is because these techniques have high spacial resolution. 

To meet the demand of active neurons, the local flow of blood to the relevant brain area increases. PET and fMRI measure these local changes in cerebral metabolism and blood flow. 

In positron emission tomography (PET), unstable positron-emitting isotopes are synthesized in a cyclotron by bombarding elements such as oxygen, carbon, or fluorine with protons. Because of its short half-life, the isotope most commonly in PET is oxygen-15. Oxygen-15 is incorporated into water molecules for activity mapping, which is injected into the bloodstream and becomes distributed in the brain. 

As the unstable isotope decays, the extra proton breaks down into a neutron and an emitted positron. The emitted positron travels several millimetres on average until it collides with an electron. The collision destroys both particles, emitting two gamma rays that travel in opposite directions from the site of the collision. Gamma-ray detectors placed around the subject's head are arranged to register a hit only when two detectors 180 degrees apart react simultaneously. By reconstructing the density of these collision lines using computer algorithms, the location of the active regions can be imaged. The PET images of activity can then be superimposed onto MRI structural images from the same subject(s). 

Limitations: the mean distance that the positrons travel in brain tissue before gamma production, as well as spatial smoothing during analysis limits spatial resolution. Moreover, PET activation imaging requires accumulating signal over a minute or so, thus it essentially has no temporal resolution. As a result, functional PET requires a blocked design. Block designs substantially limits the specificity with which brain activation can be associated with particular cognitive processes. 

### Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)

fMRI is based on the fact that oxyhaemoglobin and deoxyhaemoglobin have different magnetic resonance signals. Within a second or two after an area has been activated by a specific cognitive event or task, the related microvasculature responds to the resulting local oxygen depletion by increasing the flow of new, oxyhaemoglobin-rich arterial blood to the active area. The relative concentration of deoxyhaemoglobin decreases over the next few seconds, leading to localized changes in the magnetic resonance (MR) signal from that part of the brain. These MR changes are called the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal, which is the basis of fMRI. 

fMRI offers better spatial and temporal resolution than PET, and uses intrinsic brain function. 

Most fMRI studies in the 1900s followed the same blocked design as PET studies. But investigators soon realised that fMRI had enough temporal resolution for event-related design. The fMRI response to a stimulus or cognitive event begins at about 1 to 2 seconds, peaks at about 5 to 6 seconds, and returns to baseline at about 12 to 15 seconds. This allows selective averaging of the responses to different event types within a run. Using temporal randomization of the stimulus or task events and modern signal processing algorithms, it is now possible to present stimuli at faster rates and still extract an event-related response. Improved analytic techniques in event-related paradigms made it possible to link the behavioral measures from trial to trial to the corresponding fMRI neural responses. E.g. variations in reaction time could be examined with respect to how they co-varied with the amplitudes of the fMRI responses on a trial basis. 

### Using fMRI to analyse activation patterns within a brain area

The bulk of fMRI research has focused on activations of various brain areas as a function of cognitive conditions. However, there is considerable local organization within one area, which is often overlooked in fMRI studies. A number of approaches aimed at addressing this problem are based on pattern classification algorithms. 

Within fMRI, multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) looks at patterns of activation across voxels that consistently correspond to a particular stimulus type or event type, rather than the overall increase or decrease in activation of a large brain region. 

Repetition suppression is another way to assess functional characteristics of a brain area that respond similarly to different stimulus classes in overall activation magnitude. The brain tends to respond less to the repeated occurrence of an identical (or closely similar) stimulus (fMRI adaptation). E.g. if a region shows repetition suppression for the second stimulus in a pair, then the two stimuli must share a process supported in some way by that region. fMRI adaptation can sometimes provide additional info about the processing role of a brain region that standard fMRI cannot. E.g. comparing two stimulus conditions A and B in conventional fMRI may fail to reveal differences between them because the populations of neurons sensitive to these conditions are mixed within the same area. In the fMRI adaptation paradigm, the subpopulations of neurons sensitive to stimulus A may show adaptation when it's repeated, giving rise to a lower signal than that elicited for stimulus B. 

### Using fMRI to examine activity relationships between brain areas

Brain regions do not participate in cognitive brain function in isolation. Info flows between regions via the action potential signals transmitted by axons, which are bundled together into large **fiber tracts**. Knowledge of structural connections between brain regions can provide only a limited picture of information flow in the brain. Understanding the functional connectivity or how the activity of one brain region varies with the activity in another brain region is also needed. 

The simplest type of relationship between regions is **coactivation**, in which two or more brain regions change similarly in response to an experimental condition. A straightforward way to show functional connectivity is by **resting-state connectivity, which identify fMRI signal fluctuations that co-vary across brain regions while subjects do not perform a task. These co-variations are thought to reflect spontaneously occurring operations of the brain rather than the processing of specific external stimuli. Principal component analysis (PCA) or independent component analysis (ICA) is a way to extract the distributed patterns of common activation that occur during rest. Alternatively, one can choose a seed voxel or group of voxels in an ROI and determine which other regions exhibit similar fluctuations in activation over time. In general, regions that are coactivated during cognitive tasks also tend to show resting-state connectivity. Explicit info on the structural connections between areas in individual subjects can be obtained with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) which can help with the analyses. 

However, coactivation does not tell us much about the form of the relationship. A variety of methods are developed to gain further insight into the relationships between brain areas and their activation patterns. Psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis combines fMRI and behavioral data. It uses the time course of activity in one seed region to predict changes in activity in another region. It analyses how these interactions differ as a function of the cognitive task. E.g. whether the correlation in activity between the two areas (rather than the activity itself) differs in one task versus another. 

A shortcoming of fMRI and other neural imaging methods is its difficulty in establishing causality in the interactions between brain areas. Some modeling approaches such as structural equation modelling have tried to infer causality from fMRI activation patterns by incorporating known anatomical connections, comparing models with different hypothesized sets of directional influences between areas and identifying which model best accounts for the observed data. Related approaches include dynamic causal modelling, which creates models of the functional connections between brain regions and then evaluates how that connectivity changes as a result of experimental manipulations. 

### Optical brain imaging

Active brain tissue transmits and/or reflects light differently than does inactive brain tissue, and these differences can be picked up and imaged by optical recording devices. 

One approach is based on hemodynamic changes in response to neural activity. To detect these changes requires that the skull be opened and the cortical surface illuminated with a red light in 580-700 nanometer range. These hemodynamically based optical imaging approaches have been most successfully applied to studying sensory map representations in the sensory cortices in animals, particularly in visual cortex. 

Another technique, known as event-related optical signals (EROS), uuses optical methods based on a very different activity-dependent mechanism and can be applied noninvasively. When brain tissue is illuminated even through the skull, the amount of light that is transmitted versus scattered varies as a function of whether the neuronal tissue is electrically active. This difference is thought to arise from changes that occur in neuronal membranes and their immediate surroundings during electrical activity. These changes can be detected and images using three-dimensional computer-assisted reconstruction algorithms. EROS has high temporal resolution but relatively low spatial resolution. However there is no inverse problem in EROS.

> A variant of MRI known as diffusion-weighted imaging can delienate the white matter fiber tracts of the brain. The basis is that water molecules in living structures including the brain are always moving slightly within their local area. This movement or diffusion of water molecules affects the MR signals arising from the local voxels. Because the cellular environments experienced by the different water molecules differ across the brain, the diffusion characteristics vary as well. MRI can become sensitive to the amount of local diffusion, enabling the construction of diffusion-weighted images that reflect the diffusion characteristics across the brain. 
>
> Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) quantifies the relative diffusivity of the water molecules in each voxel into directional components. Water tends to diffuse more along fiber tract than across them because myelin is highly hydrophobic. Thus white matter shows more anistropy (has a preferred direction) in its diffusion than other brain regions which tend to be isotropic (no preferred direction). 
>
> Fractional anistropy (FA) is a scalar quantity that can be computed for each voxel to express this degree of anistropy. Some neurological diseases e.g. sclerosis and vascular dementia are characterised by white matter pathology than can be identified with FA measures. Individual differences in white matter integrity can also be identified with FA. 
>
> Tractography is a powerful application of the DTI tech that can delineate the directionality of fiber tracts in the brain. 
>
> DTI can be used in conjunction with fMRI activation studies in several ways. fMRI activation data can help guide the tractography calculations. DTI delineated fiber tracts can be used to help in functional connectivity analyses. 
>
> From a microscopic standpoint, much work is also aimed toward the goal of reconstructing the connectivity of the entire human brain at the level of neurons and synapses (connectomics). E.g. Brainbow is based on molecular genetics techniques used to delineate individual neurons and their branches by fluorescence in different colors. However connectomics faces difficulties as it needs high cost but has uncertain outcomes. 

## Assembling Evidence and Delineating Mechanisms

### Associations and dissociations

Association: experimentally associate specific cognitive functions with the neural structures and/or local neural activity that underlie them.

Dissociation: determine cognitive functions and neural processes that do not seem to be related. 

Double dissociation: E.g. impairment in task A but not B, impairment in task B but not A, shows systems A and B are dissociated. Double dissociations provide more definitive evidence because single dissociation could arise from a general factor (e.g. difficulty of task) rather than engagement of separable functions. 

Often neural systems are only partially separable (e.g. impairment of task A and slightly disturbed performance of task B). This suggests that these systems interact to some degree. 

### Multimethodological approaches

Info gleaned from different methodologies can be related across studies to synthesize findings pertinent to particular functions. We can also directly combine info across methodologies within the same or linked studies. 

E.g. using data from PET or fMRI to help source analysis of ERP or MEG. 

E.g. simultaneous EEG and fMRI. Allows trial-to-trial analysis. 

E.g. linking functional imaging in healthy individuals with similar studies in lesion patients. 

> **Neuroimaging genomics**
>
> Variations in a gene or segment of DNA are called polymorphisms, and these genetic variations can be associated with a greater risk of various neurological and psychiatric disorders. The expression of genetic variations in the brain can be manifested in both structural and functional neuroimaging data. Neuroimaging genomics refers to the application of imaging technologies to investigate how these genes are expressed in the brain.

> E.g. using fMRI to investigate memory in individuals with varying degrees of risk for Alzheimers dementia. Alzheimer risk is associated with a gene APOE. During memory task, people with greater risk show greater activation in the hippocampus and other memory-related areas. 
>
> There are also interest in the genetic influences on the transmitter systems involved in various cognitive functions. E.g. certain genetic alleles have been associated with greater levels of serotonin in key areas, and these individuals also show greater levels of anxiety in stress.
