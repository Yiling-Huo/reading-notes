# Chapter 3: Sensory Systems and Perception: Vision

For humans, the major sensory modalities are vision, audition, somatic sensation (touch pressure pain), olfaction (smell), and gustation (taste).

> Prosopagnosia is a deficiency in recognising faces. Following damage to the inferior temporal cortex typically on the right, patients are often unable to identify familiar faces. Recently, imaging and electrophysiological recordings confirmed that the ITC particularly the fusiform gyrus, mediates face recognition. 

## The Initiation of Vision

The events that lead from stimuli to perception begin with the pre-neural elements of the eye that collect and filter light energy in the environment. These elements are the cornea, lens, and ocular media that focus and filter light before it reaches the retina. The first step that entails the nervous system is the transformation of light energy into neural signals by specialized receptor cells. 

Two types of receptor cells in the retina: rods and cones, responsible for low levels and high intensities of lights respectively. 

Sensory adaptation is the continual resetting of sensitivity according to ambient conditions. Adaptation is to ensure that sensory processing occurs with maximum efficiency. The need for resetting is because environmental range is large but firing rate of visual neurons is slow. Firing rate conveys stimulus intensity, and has a maximum of a few hundred action potentials per second. The intensity of the system is continually adapted to match different ongoing levels of light intensity in the environment.
