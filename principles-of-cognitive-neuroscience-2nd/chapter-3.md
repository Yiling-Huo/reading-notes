# Chapter 3: Sensory Systems and Perception: Vision

For humans, the major sensory modalities are vision, audition, somatic sensation (touch pressure pain), olfaction (smell), and gustation (taste).

> Prosopagnosia is a deficiency in recognising faces. Following damage to the inferior temporal cortex typically on the right, patients are often unable to identify familiar faces. Recently, imaging and electrophysiological recordings confirmed that the ITC particularly the fusiform gyrus, mediates face recognition. 

## The Initiation of Vision

The events that lead from stimuli to perception begin with the pre-neural elements of the eye that collect and filter light energy in the environment. These elements are the cornea, lens, and ocular media that focus and filter light before it reaches the retina. The first step that entails the nervous system is the transformation of light energy into neural signals by specialized receptor cells. 

Two types of receptor cells in the retina: rods and cones, responsible for low levels and high intensities of lights respectively. 

Sensory adaptation is the continual resetting of sensitivity according to ambient conditions. Adaptation is to ensure that sensory processing occurs with maximum efficiency. The need for resetting is because environmental range is large but firing rate of visual neurons is slow. Firing rate conveys stimulus intensity, and has a maximum of a few hundred action potentials per second. The intensity of the system is continually adapted to match different ongoing levels of light intensity in the environment. (Here sensory adaptation refers to mechanisms in the retina cells, not in the nervous system). 

Another property of the visual system is acuity. Acuity is different from sensitivity to intensity. Acuity measures the fineness of discrimination, as in distinguisching two nearby points. Visual acuity depends on the different distribution of receptor cells across the retina. Human visual acuity falls as a function of eccentricity (visual angle away from the line of sight). Less acuity outside of the central retina means that we must frequently move our eyes and the direction of gaze to different positions in visual space. Such eye movements are called saccades. 

## Subcortical Visual Processing

The first stage of central processing takes place in the five layers of the retina. This information converges onto retinal ganglion cells whose axons leave the retina via the optic nerve, the first component of the primary visual pathway. The pathway conveys the info in light stimuli that we end up perceiving as visual scenes. Retinal circuitry modulates the information that is eventually sent forward by retinal ganglion cells.

The major target of the retina ganglion cells is the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus in the thalamus. The lateral geniculate consists of two magnocellular system layers with dense large neurons and four parvocellular system layers with smaller neurons. 

The smaller P ganglion and the related parvocellular neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus are concerned primarily with the spatial detail underlying the perception of form and brightness and color. The larger M ganglion cells and the magnocellular neurons they innervate process info about changes in stimuli that lead to motion perception. 

Neurons in both the magno and parvo layers are extensively innervated by axons descending from the cortex and other brain regions as well as those arising from retinal ganglion cells. 

## Cortical Visual Processing

The target of the lateral geniculate neurons is the primary visual cortex, aka the striate cortex or V1. The neurons in layer 4 receive the axons from neurons in the thalamus, while neurons in layers 1 and 5 of the primary visual cortex project to extrastriate visual cortical areas in the occipital parietal and temporal lobes, as well as back to the thalamus. The extrastriate cortex is generatlly considered a component of the cortical association areas (everything that is not primarily sensory or motor).

The cortical association areas integrate the qualities of a given modality as well as information from other sensory modalities and from brain regions carrying out other functions, the processing carried out by the association cortices is often referred to as higher-order. The extrastriate visual cortical areas tend to process one or more of the qualities that define visual perception. E.g., V4 is important for processing info about color, and MT (middle temporal) and MST (middle superior temporal) are important for motion percepts.

Anatomical flow of different information streams. Extrastriate cortical areas are organized into two largely separate pathways that feed infor into the temporal and parietal lobes respectively. The ventral stream (the "what" pathway) leads from the visual cortex to the inferior part of the temporal lobe. This pathway appears to be responsible for high-resolution form vision and object recognition. The dorsal stream (the "where" pathway) leads from the striate cortex and other visual areas into the parietal lobe, and is responsible for spatial aspects of vision e.g. motion and positional relationships. Thus, the temporal lobe tends to exhibit properties that are important for object recognition e.g. selectivity for shape, color, texture. Neurons in the dorsal stream show selectivity for direction and speed of movement. (However recent evidence shows cross talk between these broadly defined sensory pathways.)

Info from a specific sensation must be integrated with info being processed by the other sensory systems in the higher-order processing areas to improve efficacy. E.g. vision affects audition and vice versa, McGurk effect. 

## Other Key Characteristics of the Visual Cortex

### Topography

The organization of the receptors in the retina is reflected int he corresponding regions of both the thalamus and the visual cortex.
